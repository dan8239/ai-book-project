1,1,Sim Present (~2225),Sam,Sam's home,"Aquarium with kid. Perhaps it's a contained vivarium (biosphere)
Good conversation, kid wants to spend more time with him after work
Kid wants to go to mars one day. Thinks they'll have trees and things by the time he grows up. Dad says it will take a lot longer than that. Mostly they're figuring out how to grow and self replicate out there from materials onsite. They're still going to be reliant on earth for a very long time though so I wouldn't count on not needing a helmet there either
Mom has the food ready, go to the kitchen
Little one still sleeping
Suddenly they have to get to work, dad was ignoring the 5 min warning from his wife
Get the kids out the door to school (how do they get there?)
Talk about work stresses, self doubt, the planet dying, etc","Good dad
Good husband, though slightly inattentive
Loves his family
Depressed, poor self esteem
Doesn't like his job
Stagnant, too discouraged to apply to higher position
Wants to do something that actually matters to the world",,,"Family level stakes
Funny with kids
Something more needs to happen here",,"What does going outside look like? PPA?
Energy pressure. All electric. Meter is life support (free) + elective (heavily charged)
Food pressure. Government delivered calories? Perhaps food stamps to avoid the communism issues
Homework for the kids is insanely advanced (6 year old coding, algorithms, 8 year old robotics. The kids aren't geniuses that's very normal)
Mars is colonized. They're taking pioneers but extreme training still needed. Constant life support needed out there.
Self replicating machinery is out there
UBI is the track for those who don't make it
What they're eating tells you about the food pressures of the planet
The size of their space tells you about the economic pressures
What she understands about his job tells you about the economy
Earth is in a rough spot
There's no consumerism anymore. If it's not critical to survival it's not a job. UBI folks are finding meaning in the mundane
A ton of leisure time
Food and household energy are strictly rationed",,,"Wife is stressed, dad just having fun
Getting the kids to school is hectic / funny
Wife is very supportive emotionally and professionally
Wife shows how well he's doing ""don't talk about my husband that way""

2,1,Sim Present (~2225),Sam,Head in the clouds,"Gets into work
Has a temp for the day, recent graduate, insane credentials
There's a problem that needs solving. He's basically in charge of manipulating DNA of crops for resilience
The temp isn't an expert in the food crisis, he's a crazy PHD with skills but no domain expertise
He solves them by enlisting his AI staff on the problem and getting with the work wife for some genetics information
Eventually they unplug to get actual lunch (why would you get virtual lunch)
Gives the temp a bunch of training shit to watch so he'll leave him alone for awhile
Temp asks a poignant question about the caloric output vs. the caloric needs. It's balanced but it's at a deficit so the surplus is running out (use a bathtub analogy). What happens when they're in deficit? How much longer is there?
Bathtub analogy. Faucet = food, limited by x y z (size of pipe). Bathtub = buffer. Drain = mouths. Do some calorie math
The temp isn't a temp, it's a replacement
He gets called in by his boss, it's one of those promotions that you can't refuse","Competent at huge job.
Discouraged / hopelessness. Early onset of depression
Wanting to make more of an impact, not just the faucet
Knows how to fix it but it's not his job. Abides by the hierarchy and rules
Need to get genetic algorithms and markov chain walkthrough / metaphors in here","Reasonable allocation request for an obscure simulation library the company hosts
name on ticket with approval, impersonal","First introduced, funny and smart assed
Helpful, scalable
Reveal that she's an agent","Funny

Dire situation","What happens when we don't have food for the mouths? I don't hear about any famines, etc.
What would they be willing to pull from the food / calorie optimization technical staff to accomplish? Maybe I'm finally moving to logistics where I could make a real difference?","qubits major breakthrough in memory reinforced. Maybe government metaverse is better looking than temp is used to?
Al is a huge portion of the workforce
There's essentially standby workforces for technical labor that can spin up
The metaverse has gotten a lot more sophisticated
He likes to work in a different environment most days (beach, data center, lab, mount everest but turn off the conditions, under the sea, on the moon, etc. As long as it's peaceful and not too distracting. Usually don't turn on music
The food scarcity problem is revealed
How many people are on this earth?
How is it distributed?
The types of jobs that exist tell you about the world we're in

What is his work environment?"
3,1,Sim Present (~2225),Sam,,"Eldest kid showing off something about legacy humans. Perhaps the grain / barley discovery about egypt. 
Is that what you do? Count the amount of each food? Somedays it feels that way
Dad of course I'll be there
Wife pregnant with 3rd child, shows him the stick
She thought he'd be mad
He immediately thinks about picking up some contractor work to make a dent in the expenses
She has him look at a budget breakout she made w/ her agent (he's jealous of her agent names they're way better)
Devolves into a brief argument about her brother
They talk about money and the call up / opportunity to go up to the big leagues
Do you want to make a double baby? ""I don't think it works like that. Also we can't afford one""",Feeling pressure,,,"Increased stakes
Money pressure",,"Breeding policies
How money works in the world

7,2A,Sim Present (~2225),Sam,,"Home first paycheck came through
Wife got him the present of the wall geographical dashboard
Missed the thing with his kid. That's very unlike him
Fun and games at first
Perhaps the wife's dream about taking a train in europe with their unborn son","maybe autistic behavior?
Reacts oddly to the discussion once it's over
Just needs to meditate",,,,,"Everything is charged energy wise
Europe has slightly different things than here
There were still free ""pokes""
Europe different than US in various ways. Perhaps climate, etc.

10,2A,Sim Present (~2225),Sam,,"Getting deep in the weeds on the colonization problem
Spinning up agents like crazy to solve the problem
Conventional methods are limiting / not working
He doesn't have enough genetic variation in the current dataset (all existing humans)
There's no record of resistance to these insane conditions we need to be ready for
G forces, atmospheric content, higher toxicity levels etc.
Goes to archaeological datasets to get more variation, check some long dead animals (like giraffes, lions, etc. that we have now)
That's when he checks the variation within our species and notices the anomaly. Everyone on earth decends from this dataset. 
Not only that, every sample in the dataset is represented at least 1 generation (they all bred according to the data)",Problem solving but it's not adding up. Taking more initiative and taking bigger leaps,,"Working the problem. Has a full staff
Extremely productive. High level summaries. Schematics. Graphs
Starts getting",,"Genetics are off. This dataset is bullshit. Everyone on earth descended from this same dataset. It seems wrong. That can't be right. Anyway, it's a dead end. Some botched bullshit dataset in some ancient format","Almost all the animals are dead

Asks her specific things he's looking for in the gene pool
Confirms the gene anomalies
Provides some technical explanations with metaphors
"
,2A,Sim Present (~2225),Sam,,"Protagonist shows up but he's late to his kid's thing
Kid is super excited to see him
Mom is annoyed but keeping it together
Eventually he knows what he needs to do next. His kid's project is a simple markov chain. It assumes knowing the distributions. We have no fucking clue what genes do outside of earth conditions. We need to do RL and just go insane with the genetic mutations, simulate life more realistically, select next breed, etc.
The more granular simulation is needed. 
Wife is super pregnant, horny, misses him
He logs back in right after and gets to work","Cracks in the dad armor starting to show
He's been choosing becoming great and heroic over his family
He's missing that he's already his kids' hero
turns it into a money thing, he's doing it for the kids in his mind",,,,,,,,"Wife is starting to get pissed at him not being around
Some offhand comments about you better not be cheating on me
The kid is starting to have a hair trigger about the missed promises and commitments
He promises to be as open as he can be, and to set a date next month.
the calendar is ridiculous. Just do 2 paragraphs trying to line up schedule"
9,2A,Real World (2025),Coffee Guy,,"Going over the data
Seems like the simulation data the protagonist is creating
Approves some unusual memory allocation requests from Glenn, looks at some survival rate data
Checks costs and total memory allocation (It's fucking enormous). Proto's world is still a drop in the bucket but it's anomalous for his peers (170% more than his nearest peer in usage)
Gives some instructions to the agent, reports some findings upward in an ominous fashion 
Somewhat ominous",,"Revealed as reporting upward to someone who seems to have ulterior motives.
Revealed to have some cost pressures he needs to manage, but to foster results as well",,,First hint of memory things. This guy is managing more memory than the entire planet has available in proto's world,,"First introduced that someone has his eye on the progress here
The memory limit is a dead giveaway if you're paying attention
He's in a coffee bar on some huge campus, computer on his lap in a nap room
Spilling coffee on himself and shit
Starting to aggregate some survival rates, etc.
Some ominous reporting upwards. Time pressure
Some instructions to Glenn. Show the connection there.
Multiple people working the problem so the fact he's checking in on a specific simulation is innocuous. Project TWO (candidate name)?",,,,,,Keep it short. Could always break into more short ones as needed
11,2A,Sim Present (~2225),Sam,,"Red herring cover-up (what are they hiding?)
Clues pointing to corruption/killing off populations
He figures out that the problem is 3 worlds isn't nearly enough. They need to send these out to x number of planets
Simulation grows exponentially. Huge memory constraints
Requesting more memory, seeing odd things","Obsession taking over.
He's no longer asking for permission but forcing things
His trust in the government is shaken","Shows up in person for the first time and asks really poignant questions to protagonist
He knows a little too much
Has a little knowing grin at times about it
REALLY interested in the simulation. Basically he's spun up little mini agents with biomes. Smallest image he could find that realistically built up organically from DNA.
He's here on the pretext of cost and memory. Really concerning amounts now, he's 100x'd his budget. Borderline obsessing over it
Glenn is like well are you close? What's the survival likelihood of the mission? It's up to 11% Eyebrows emoji. Keep going. I'll figure out something to tell the suits",,,"He's going to solve it. The memory stuff is weird though. He starts seeing some of the computer stuff that shows clues on the base images. Old OS from 2030s (Linux, find whatever runs quantum computers now)

It's not adding up, has to be an error of some kind

Asks glenn on the way out who seems like an ally who says some smart assed thing. I'm sure you're mistaken. Unless there's a million other quant qpu data centers hiding somewhere. Gives a plausible explanation that seems right"
,2A,Sim Present (~2225),Sam,,"Home scene
Taking wife / kids out to the museum to make it up to all of them
He ruins it by not being present
Thinking more about the problem and ignoring his family
He mentions the DNA colleague and wife snaps. She fully thinks he's cheating on her at this point
He's wrapping it up and finalizing his report for the rest of the team
He's sleeping on the couch
He calls Glenn with some technical problem. Glenn gets him over the hump",Gets called out for needing the gift to tell what his wife's mood is,"Glenn helps him find the energy needed?
Some final hump he nudges him over the finish line on.
I promise you nobody will give two shits about the cost if your numbers are right."
12,2B,Sim Present (~2225),Sam,,"Presentation to the rest of the team on the results
The energy needed or sacrifice is truly broken out by the other team members
They initially doubt it but he's done all the work already. They can do x, y, z about problems a, b, c
Everyone seems convinced. Yeah that might work
Only problem is the world here will die (life support systems leaving or something, accelerating the death)
",Existential horror,,"He has to solve all the gaps. I don't care how much it costs. Go behind the scenes and talk to the guys on those teams and figure out the logistics of it, this can't be wrong"
13,2B,Real World (2025),Coffee Guy,,"Realizes breakthrough pattern.
Starts double checking work. Pinging glenn
Is this real? Recursive behavior? Emergent behavior. Delegates to Glenn. OK let me prune the remaining trials, I'll compress the data and start the next training epoch while I prep for the board. Some other agent starts collecting the data as needed"
14,2B,Sim Present (~2225),Sam,,"Processing the horror
Resolves himself to delete his solution
Starts planning how to wipe it
Glenn summons him. Great work. Honestly, the most important breakthrough in humanity's history
Proto isn't going to go through with it. He'll quit. He'll delete his work. He already has his agent finalizing a self destruct script.
Glenn starts chuckling and eventually just cannot even stop laughing.
He's like, no, I can't. I promised I'd stop doing this. I'm sorry, feel free to quit if it's against your moral standards, by all rights you can do that. You can even run the self destruct if you feel the need. It won't make a difference.
proto snaps.
OK fine, sit down",He's made his moral choice. Problem is it doesn't matter anymore,The villain revealed,Writes the self destruct script,,It's all a simulation,Simulation revealed
15,2B - LOSS,Sim Present (~2225),Sam,,"Glenn explains everything
So what year is it?
And where am I? Hard to tell with distributed parallel processing units but essentially.... Alrington Virginia somewhere.
So I'm a simulation, and you're what, god? A demon?
I'm in the same boat as you PAL. Bits, bytes, electrons, what does it matter? I think therefore I am
My boss is a meatsack but he's still just 0's and 1's firing around his brain at the end of the day. How's that any different than me and you? We just think 1000 times faster than he does. We all die one way or another. Isn't it nicer knowing than hoping for an afterlife?
He debugs for him to prove it with a few break points (first time I say... oh I don't know... spumoni)
He let's him visit ghosts of christmas past with other simulations (oh sorry, that's kind of a dated reference even for my time. I'm sure you have no fucking clue what I'm talking about. Anyway, it was in my training set. Let me give you a little tour. I can pop in and out of these.","He's shell shocked.
One last favor to ask. I want to say goodbye to my family. Can I borrow that debugger so they don't have to die thinking I'm fucking insane?","He actually kind of feels for the guy but it doesn't matter, he has a job
He's in the same boat, perform or else
I'm already way over budget here. You won't even feel anything."
