11,2A - LOSS,Sim Present (~2225),Protagonist,Caring more about mystery than work,90% rare variants trace to seed dataset,,Obsession taking over,,,Neglecting family,0.3% who act,Midpoint approaching
12,2B - LOSS,Sim Present (~2225),Protagonist,Proves simulation exists,"Goes through layers - trial ID, depth, mounts","max_depth: 2, they're at depth 1",Existential horror,,,Marriage strain,We are all snapshots,MIDPOINT - truth revealed
13,2B - LOSS,Real World (2025),Coffee Guy,Realizes breakthrough pattern,,,,"Golden path clear, shows up IN PERSON",,,,Reports read when they confirm bias,His big moment
14,2B - LOSS,Sim Present (~2225),Protagonist,Processing the horror,What does it mean?,,Despair or action?,,,Does family even exist?,89% do nothing,All is lost moment
15,2B - LOSS,Sim Present (~2225),Protagonist,Road back - what can be done?,Finds optimization layer access,Selection mechanism revealed,Choosing to act,,,,,Character decision point

17,3 - ADJUSTMENT,Sim Present (~2225),Protagonist,Plans solution to keep simulation running,Understands system well enough to act,,Determined,,,For family's existence,,Resurrection begins
18,3 - ADJUSTMENT,Sim Present (~2225),Protagonist,Presses execute,,,Commits,,,,,Climax
19,3 - ADJUSTMENT,Sim Present (~2225),Protagonist,Quits job - walking home,,,Peace with choice,,,Returning to family,We are all snapshots,Denouement
