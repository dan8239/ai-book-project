Beat,Act,Story Circle,Approx %,Purpose,Goals / Questions to Answer,Sam's Plot,Notes
Prologue,—,—,0%,Establish real world stakes and tone,"What's happening in the real world? What's the ominous setup?","Coffee Guy practicing presentation on way to work. Grant Melrose and Quant exposition. World is in trouble. Protocol initiated.",P2 chosen. Keep short.
Opening Image,1,YOU (comfort),1%,Visual/emotional snapshot BEFORE change,"What's Sam's world? What's the vibe? Show him in comfort zone.","Aquarium with eldest son. Good dad moment. But he's half-present — mind already elsewhere. Thinking about what's next. Eldest mentions january_gymrats, Sam doesn't engage.","january_gymrats aside shows inattentiveness"
Set Up,1,YOU (comfort),1-10%,Status quo. Plant the want. Hint at transformation,"What does Sam THINK he wants? What's broken but tolerable? Who matters?","Family morning. He's accomplished — retiring at 31 like a pro athlete. Restless. He THINKS he wants to do something important. What he actually wants (won't admit): LEGACY. His name to outlast him. He's already doing important work but can't see it.",The lie he believes: legacy = meaning
Theme Stated,1,NEED (desire),~5%,What is this story about?,"What truth will Sam learn? Someone says it — he doesn't get it yet.","Ramona: 'I just want you here' or 'This is the only shot we get.' Sam brushes it off. He's focused on what's next, not what's now.",Within Set Up section
Catalyst,1,GO (unfamiliar),12%,Jolt to the status quo,"What disrupts everything? What opportunity appears?","Called up to colonization project. Genetic seed ship. His name on every planet. The ultimate legacy.",
Debate,1,GO (unfamiliar),12-25%,Internal conflict. Why resist?,"Why would he say no? What's the cost? What's he torn between?","Ramona is pregnant with 3rd (taboo). She wants him present for this phase. Tina's people need help — Ramona is torn between worlds. Sam's choice: legacy vs. presence. NOT money — they're set. The job is pure ego.",Remove money pressure. Stakes are relational.
Break into Two,1,GO (unfamiliar),25%,Crosses threshold. No going back.,"What choice does he make? What world does he enter?","Accepts colonization job. Enters new world of stakes, resources, compute power. He's chasing legacy now. Glenn (Driver for colonization) approves his resource request — just a name in the system.",Glenn intro: just a signature
B Story,2A,SEARCH (adapt),30%,Relationship that carries theme,"Who represents the truth Sam needs to learn? What relationship pressures the main plot?","Ramona and the marriage. She's closing off as he dives deeper into work. Gravitating back toward Tina's world/lifestyle. The contrast between Sam's 'saving humanity' ambition and Ramona's 'be here now' philosophy.",B story = marriage deteriorating
Fun and Games,2A,SEARCH (adapt),30-50%,Promise of the premise. The cool stuff.,"What did we come to see? Sam being competent. Technical problem-solving. AI craziness.","Solving colonization. AI swarms. Technical competence porn. Mystery clues emerge: memory allocation impossibly large, ancient OS timestamps, population bottleneck anomaly. Glenn async rapport — weirdly helpful replies, knows too much. Sam finds maintenance logs: Frank Thomas → Randy Johnson → Glenn Robinson. Same entity.","Clues planted. Glenn rapport builds."
— Birthday Scene,2A,SEARCH,~32%,Sam trying to save relationship,"How does Sam try to fix things? What gift does he give?","Sam gives Ramona the Memory Map gadget. Europe study abroad exposition. The 'poke' story. Sharks and minnows game with eldest son. Trying to be present but mind elsewhere. Ramona notices.","Memory Map introduced. Eldest son bonding."
— Gondola,2A,SEARCH,~35%,Journey to the mountain,"What's the visual world? What does Ramona explain?","Gondola ride up. Desert mountain in BC. Ramona's geology expertise — rock strata as snapshots in time. Skiing memory (they don't really know what it was). Ramona briefs Sam on rules.",World reveal: climate change
— The Mountain (Hike),2A,SEARCH,~36%,First leg of journey to legacy humans,"What history is revealed? What's the entrance like?","Trailhead, automated guide. Rossland mining history. The Boring Machine. Plastic dump / middens. Eye of the Needle entrance. Ramona's Christian background, teasing exchange.","Rossland history. Eye of the Needle."
— First Contact,2A,SEARCH,~38%,Meeting legacy humans,"What's the deal? What does Sam see?","The descent. Gravity battery reveal — football fields wide, Rubik's cube of concrete. Sam's math flex impresses leader. The deal: Sam optimizes their systems for 5x energy, gets DNA + all their data (life/death, food production, energy inputs, failure points). Meets Tina — pale identical twin.",Quid pro quo established. Tina intro.
— Optimization Tour,2A,SEARCH,~45%,Sam's second visit. Models challenged.,"What does Sam learn? How do his assumptions fail?","Month 1 wins failed. Month 2 metrics went UP. Tours with Mike/Steve/Tim. Aquifer, pump scare, cooling systems. Sam discovers his model's assumptions were wrong. Out-of-sample data breaks models. Ramona daydreaming about moving underground.","The key learning: optimization only as good as your information"
Midpoint,2A,FIND (get desire),50%,Devastating truth. Stakes raised.,"What does Sam GET that changes everything?","Glenn appears in person. 'We should talk.' Reveals simulation truth. Sam found his genetic answer — and got way more than he wanted. Everything he's working toward is meaningless. His legacy project is just training data.",The hinge. Everything changes.
— Extended Reveal,2A/2B,FIND,~52%,Glenn explains everything,"What does Sam learn about his reality?","Glenn's 'I'm not a god' monologue. Shows Sam brother simulations — parallel trials with similar genetics. The weird shit Glenn's tried (made a guy immortal, still screaming). Glenn gives one breakpoint as cruel gift.",Glenn as Driver. Sam as Controller.
Bad Guys Close In,2B,TAKE (pay price),55-75%,Resistance increases. Doubt. Pressure internal and external.,"How does it get worse? What's closing in?","Processing horror. Marriage crumbling — Ramona thinks he's hiding something (she's right, but thinks affair). Tries to quit/delete — Glenn laughs, it won't matter. Colonization continues but Sam is hollow. Uses Memory Map to read wife's mood — she's hurt he needs gadget.",Expand this section
— Tina Betrayal,2B,TAKE,~65%,Fallout from colonization truth,"How does Tina find out? What's the fallout?","Ramona visits colony. Tina finds out Sam's colonization work = building escape pods for the rich, abandoning people like her. Betrayal comes out through Ramona — makes it worse. Falling out.",Comes through Ramona
All Is Lost,2B,TAKE (pay price),75%,Defeat is absolute. Everything won is meaningless.,"What makes Sam feel totally defeated?","Epoch ending. Can't escape. Can't save humanity. Can't save his family. Simulation will be compressed.",Clear beat
Dark Night of Soul,2B,TAKE (pay price),75-80%,Rock bottom. Face the darkness.,"What does Sam sit with? What does he finally face?","Comes clean to Ramona. Tells her everything. She believes him (no breakpoint needed — she knows him). Her response: 'Who cares if it's a simulation? How does it change my life?' She's not devastated. She's at peace. He finally hears her.",He saves the breakpoint for the heist
Break into Three,3,RETURN,80%,New insight. Another path forward.,"What does Sam realize? How does B story unlock the answer?","Ramona: 'I'd keep it running if I could. I'll be happy with every minute we get.' Sam reframes: not 'stop Big Dog' but 'keep us running.' The heist idea forms. Goes to Tina with the final deal.",Wife's line unlocks the plan
— Mountain Visit 3,3,RETURN,~85%,The heist deal,"What does Sam trade? What does Tina provide?","Final deal: 'Everything. All my credits. All royalties. You get it all.' In exchange: Tina's help. She's the blind spot — identical DNA to Ramona, invisible to Glenn's model.",
Finale,3,RETURN,85-99%,Resolution. Apply what's learned. Final confrontation.,"How does Sam use what he's learned? Does he succeed?","The heist. Memory spike triggers Glenn. Breakpoint used. Tina as out-of-sample variable breaks Glenn's model. AI assistant takeover. Coffee Guy approves routine-looking task list. Simulation copied to hidden server.",
Final Image,3,CHANGE,99%,Mirror/opposite of opening. Shows transformation.,"How is it same but different?","Aquarium again. Same scene. But Sam is truly present now. Asks eldest about january_gymrats. Doesn't know if he's the copy or the original. Doesn't care. He's here.",Callback to opening
Epilogue,—,—,100%,Denouement,"What's the final note?","Data center zoom? Coffee Guy aftermath? TBD",Optional
