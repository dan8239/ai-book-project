# Opening Scene Concept

## First Chapter, First Line

Someone looking over protagonist's shoulder at their computer asks: **"What are you optimizing for?"**

Protagonist explains the specific problem they're working on and the loss function.

## What This Reveals

Through protagonist's explanation of their work problem, we learn:
- What this society cares about
- How protagonist gets paid / earns money
- What their job is
- Who hired them and why
- Problems they're running into
- The world's priorities and values

**The problem protagonist is optimizing says everything about the time they're living in.**

## Why This Works

- Immediately establishes "optimization" as central theme
- Natural exposition through work conversation
- Shows protagonist's technical competence
- Reveals world-building organically
- Sets up the meta-question: what SHOULD we optimize for?

## Still To Decide

- What specific problem is protagonist working on?
- What does this reveal about their world's configuration?
- Who is asking the question? (colleague, Claude assistant, romantic interest?)
