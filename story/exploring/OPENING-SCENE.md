# Opening Scene Concept

## First Chapter, First Line

Someone looking over protagonist's shoulder at their computer asks: **"What are you optimizing for?"**

Protagonist explains the specific problem they're working on and the loss function.

## What This Reveals

Through protagonist's explanation of their work problem, we learn:
- What this society cares about
- How protagonist gets paid / earns money
- What their job is
- Who hired them and why
- Problems they're running into
- The world's priorities and values

**The problem protagonist is optimizing says everything about the time they're living in.**

## Why This Works

- Immediately establishes "optimization" as central theme
- Natural exposition through work conversation
- Shows protagonist's technical competence
- Reveals world-building organically
- Sets up the meta-question: what SHOULD we optimize for?

## The Optimization Problem

**What protagonist is working on:**
- Genetic balancing/ideal selection of gene diversity for self-replicating nursery pods
- Part of civilization starter kit program (mass pods sent to viable planets)
- Low individual success rate but high aggregate probability across many planets
- Technical/minute optimization, not grand strategy

**Protagonist's backstory:**
- Newly assigned to this position
- Got it through meritocracy - did something extraordinary in previous job
- Partner/colleague will ask about that previous achievement

**Program status (TBD):**
- How far along is the nursery pod/starter kit program?
- Tech just proven? Building phase? Already launched? Fully operational?

## Who Asks The Question?

Partner/colleague working with protagonist on the optimization project
