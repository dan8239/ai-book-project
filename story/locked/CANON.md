What's locked in. Last updated: 2025-09-29

## 1. World Mechanics

### 1.1 The Simulation Structure & Timeline
- Protagonist exists on the FIRST simulation layer
- Entire existence spans milliseconds in a quantum processing unit (QPU) in real time
- But in simulated time: started at real present day, has run for hundreds of years
- Multiple generations of humans within the simulation

**Timeline within simulation:**
- Coffee guy: Real world present day (outside simulation)
- Devsecops guy: A few generations before protagonist (within simulation)
- Protagonist: Current generation in simulation (piecing together devsecops message)

- Recursive: each layer of AI studies the previous generation
- Started with real human biological/historical data (23andMe-style company)
- Multiple layers exist below the first layer (protagonist's layer)

#### Why Recursive Layers Exist
The company coffee guy works for aims to find humanity's golden path. By letting the simulations themselves try to figure that out:
- More extreme edge cases can be explored than in the current real-life scenario
- First layer models modern day life accurately (policy changes to current population)
- Nested layers enable emergent behavior and more extreme simulations
- Higher percentage of population can be devoted to solving the problem
- Moral considerations are one layer removed
- Entire nested populations can work on KPIs derived from main OKRs
- Less directly tied to top-level simulation

### 1.2 The Real World (Coffee Guy's Layer)
- Essentially present day but AI significantly more advanced
- Quantum tech advancements: memory solved, enables realistic simulations
- More energy efficient simulation (research needed: realistic implementation and advantages)
- Resource crisis: severe pressure on food, water, energy
- Desertification: much more desert-like areas
- 23andMe-style company collected biological/behavioral data over evolutionary timescales
- That data seeded the first simulation layer
- Time compression: Coffee guy's total chapter time = one day while entire simulation runs
- Resource pressure shows in subtle ways (research needed: what small changes reveal water/energy/food scarcity)

### 1.3 Technology & Governance (In-Simulation - Protagonist's World)
- Hundreds of years advanced from real present day
- Multiple generations of advancement within simulation
- Mandatory tracking shot at birth (started at some timestamp in simulated history)
- Quantum computing exists
- Data preservation has memory constraints
- Celebrities/leaders get more detailed simulation than general population
- Optimization/extreme A/B testing is a core policy of this world

**Governmental Structure:**
- Global optimization requires power beyond nation-states
- Tech company coup (Amazon/Google/OpenAI equivalents) consolidated power
- Either: happening at cusp in real world (coffee guy's time)
- Or: already happened in simulation, origin/before-times not recalled

**Geography/Climate:**
- City located in Idaho desert area
- Arid climate, dry conditions
- Resource constraints visible in environment

### 1.4 The Simulation Data
- 847+ million trials run
- Trials run until extinction OR stability threshold (low ongoing extinction risk)
- Median extinction: 127 years (most die between 75-150 years)
- Peak death zone: civilizations with nukes/AI/climate crisis but lacking coordination
- 0.04% reach stability threshold (the golden path)
- Success requires hitting 5 critical decision points correctly (combined probability: ~0.04%)

### 1.5 Memory and Epochs
- NO memory persistence between iterations
- Protagonist doesn't remember previous 2,762,639 refusals
- No déjà vu, dreams, or "feeling" from past runs
- Works like actual genetic algorithms (each trial is fresh)
- Epochs last until humanity kills itself OR prospers beyond reasonable extinction
- Could be decades, centuries, millennia of simulated time (outcome-based, not time-based)

### 1.6 The Optimization Goal
**NOT:** How long can you survive?
**IS:** What minimizes long-term extinction probability?

- Trials run until extinction (record failure mode) OR stability threshold reached
- Survival time is a PROXY for extinction risk, not the goal itself
- Primary metric: probability of future extinction given current trajectory
- Secondary: quality of life, sustainability, adaptability
- Failure modes tracked: nuclear war, climate collapse, AI misalignment, resource depletion, pandemic, social collapse

Goal: Find policy configurations that reach low ongoing extinction risk

**Golden Path Solution (The 0.04% Success):**
- Mass nursery pods with robotic civilization starter kits sent to viable planets
- Self-replicating technology
- Low individual pod success rate but high aggregate probability across many planets
- Genetic diversity optimization critical to self-replication success

## 2. The Optimization System

### 2.1 The Loss Function

**Ultimate Goal:** DNA propagation and survival across cosmic timescales

**Hierarchy:**
1. Survival (food, shelter, safety - Maslow's base)
2. Organization (religion, politics, nations - prevent chaos at scale)
3. Energy & Peaceful Consolidation (avoid self-annihilation while growing) ← novel's focus
4. Interstellar Expansion (Kardashev scale, reach the stars)

**Current Epoch's Primary KPI:** Aligned energy consolidation without self-destruction

### 2.2 Why Full Lifetimes
Optimization happens at multiple timescales:
- Per-trial: Individual human life outcomes
- Per-generation: NSGA-II style selection from multiple trials
- Per-epoch: Adjustment to intermediate loss functions (KPIs)

Can't shortcut—complexity emerges over full lifetime.

### 2.3 The Selection Mechanism

**When epoch completes:**
1. Selected individuals are pulled out
2. Veil is removed—they learn they were in simulation
3. They're shown their stats (including iteration count)
4. They're offered the choice

**The Choice:**
- Join optimization layer: Help adjust loss functions for next epoch, influence KPIs
- Get reset: Tossed back in when RAM clears, no memory, run again

**Selection Criteria:**
- Leadership ability
- Energy/resource consolidation
- Long-term thinking
- Will they act when they discover truth? (0.3% test)

**Statistics:**
- 89% do nothing after discovering truth
- 10.7% self-destruct
- 0.3% act

**Purpose:** Selected individuals become the mechanism for adjusting optimization—review what worked/failed, adjust intermediate loss functions, set parameters for next generation. This is how the system self-optimizes.

**The Dark Question:** Is the optimization layer real, or just another simulation layer? (Turtles all the way up)

## 3. Characters
