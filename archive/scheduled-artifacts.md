# Scheduled Artifacts

Pre-scripted discoveries planted by the simulation system.

## The Old DNA Dataset

The key artifact that protagonist analyzes.

**What it appears to be:** Old server with DNA data from before The Refactor.

**What it actually is:** Present-day genetic data from before simulation - the **origin dataset** that bootstrapped the simulation. Contains whatever 23andMe-type companies had: current day humans plus mapped genomes and some historical data.

**How protagonist gets it:** Archaeological discovery - an old CPU/server recovered and sent to his team for analysis.

## The Scheduled Discoveries System

**Location:** `/sim/artifacts/scheduled_discoveries/`

**What it contains:**
- Pre-generated archaeological finds for future years
- `discovery_003_cpu.dat` scheduled for year 2225
- Discoveries are scripted, not random

**Implication:** The simulation plants "discoveries" at predetermined times to guide the narrative. What feels like chance archaeological finds are actually curated reveals.

## The Message Within

Someone in the past (simulation early days) discovered this system and modified one of the scheduled artifacts. They overwrote `discovery_003_cpu.dat` with the real seed data, ensuring that whoever analyzed it would find the population bottleneck evidence.

A message across simulated time.

#needs-work - Who planted this? Could be:
- An earlier protagonist-type who figured it out
- A system glitch that exposed real data
- Intentional by the simulation runners (test? experiment?)
