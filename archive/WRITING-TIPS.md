# Writing Tips for Science Fiction

## Leveraging Your Music/Lyrical Background

### Rhythm and Flow
Like music, prose has rhythm. Your experience with lyrical writing is a huge advantage:

**From lyrics to prose:**
- **Syllable count** → Sentence length variation
- **Rhyme scheme** → Repeated phrases/motifs
- **Verse/chorus** → Scene/chapter structure
- **Bridge** → Plot twist or perspective shift
- **Hook** → Memorable lines that stick with readers

**Practical tips:**
1. Read your prose aloud—if it sounds awkward, it reads awkward
2. Vary sentence length like you'd vary note length
3. Use punctuation like rests in music
4. Create "hooks"—memorable phrases that recur

### Emotional Resonance
Music bypasses the logical brain and hits emotion directly. Prose can too:

- **Show, don't tell** = Let the melody speak, not just lyrics
- **Subtext** = The emotion between the notes
- **Build and release tension** = Dynamics in music
- **Themes and motifs** = Recurring musical themes

### Structure
A novel is like a concept album:
- Each chapter is a song with its own arc
- But they all serve the album's (book's) larger story
- Transitions matter
- The order creates meaning

## Science Fiction Specifics

### The Hard SF Balance
When writing hard science fiction:

**Technical accuracy** ⚖️ **Narrative flow**

**Too much tech**:
> "The quantum decoherence manifold interface required a 47-dimensional Hilbert space transformation using non-unitary operators..."

**Too little tech**:
> "She pressed the button and the thing worked."

**Just right**:
> "She pressed her palm to the interface. The quantum manifold shuddered into alignment, forty-seven dimensions collapsing into three she could perceive. The air tasted like copper and mathematics."

### World-Building Without Info-Dumping

**Bad (info dump)**:
> In 2157, after the Climate Wars of 2089-2094 and the subsequent Great Migration, humanity had rebuilt society using fusion power and vertical farming, governed by the Council of Twelve, which had replaced the old nation-state system.

**Good (show through action)**:
> Sarah's apartment spanned levels 47 through 49 of the vertical farm. Through the floor, she could see kale rippling in the circulated air, and below that, the fusion core's faint blue glow—the heart of New Denver, built by her grandparents' generation after the old city burned.

**Key**: Reveal world through character interaction, not exposition.

### The "Novum" (New Thing)
Every SF story has a novum—the one big idea that makes it science fiction:
- Time travel
- AI consciousness
- FTL travel
- Uploaded minds
- Alien contact

**Your job**:
1. Pick your novum
2. Explore its implications rigorously
3. Make everything else support this exploration

### Science Fiction vs. Fantasy
**Fantasy**: Magic does what the plot needs
**Science Fiction**: Science limits what the plot can do

Constraints create better stories. If your quantum computer can do *anything*, it's magic. If it can do specific things with specific costs, it's science fiction.

## First-Time Book Writer Advice

### It's a Marathon, Not a Sprint
**Expected timeline**: 6-24 months for a first novel

**Typical word counts**:
- Novella: 17,500-40,000 words
- Novel: 50,000-110,000 words
- SF typically: 80,000-120,000 words

**Break it down**:
- 80,000 words = 320 pages = 20 chapters = ~4,000 words/chapter
- Write 500 words/day = Done in 160 days (~5 months)
- Write 1,000 words/day = Done in 80 days (~3 months)

### You Don't Have to Write Linearly
Benefits of this C4 system:
- Write scenes as they come to you
- Fill in the structure later
- Revise iteratively

Some authors write:
1. The ending first (so you know where you're going)
2. All the action scenes
3. Then fill in the connective tissue

### The First Draft Will Be Bad
**Everyone's first draft is bad.** Your job is to:
1. Get words on the page
2. Revise, revise, revise
3. Get feedback
4. Revise more

Hemingway: "The first draft of anything is shit."

### Show Your Work Early
Don't wait until it's "perfect" (it never will be):
- Share chapters with friends
- Post to communities (r/scifiwriting, etc.)
- Get beta readers
- Learn from feedback

This public repo strategy is perfect for this.

## Working With Claude Code

### What Claude Does Well
1. **Structure and organization**: Planning, outlining, C4 docs
2. **Worldbuilding consistency**: Tracking rules and details
3. **Technical accuracy**: Fact-checking science
4. **Alternative suggestions**: "What if instead..."
5. **Editing**: Grammar, flow, style consistency

### What Claude Struggles With
1. **Your unique voice**: Only you have your style
2. **Emotional truth**: Real human experience
3. **Creative leaps**: Surprising connections
4. **Knowing what you want**: You're the director

### Best Practices
1. **Be specific**: "Write a tense confrontation scene between X and Y about Z" not "Write something"
2. **Iterate**: First draft from Claude → You edit → Refine
3. **Use for scaffolding**: Outline → You write → Claude helps revise
4. **Keep control**: You're the author, Claude is the assistant

### Prompt Templates

**For scenes**:
```
Write a [tone] scene where [character] [action] in [setting].
The purpose is to [goal].
Include: [specific elements].
Style: [reference to similar work or specific style notes].
Length: ~[word count] words.
```

**For dialogue**:
```
Write dialogue between [character A] and [character B].
A wants: [goal]
B wants: [goal]
Conflict: [what's at stake]
Subtext: [what they're not saying]
Tone: [conversational/formal/tense/etc.]
```

**For worldbuilding**:
```
Describe [element of world] in [setting].
Focus on: [sensory details/social implications/technical function]
Related to: [how it connects to plot/theme]
```

## The Writing Process

### Phase 1: Planning (C4 L1-L2)
- Define the story
- Map major structure
- No prose yet
- **Time**: 1-2 weeks

### Phase 2: Component Design (C4 L3)
- List all scenes
- Character arcs
- World details
- **Time**: 2-4 weeks

### Phase 3: First Draft (C4 L4)
- Write all scenes
- Don't self-edit yet
- Get it done
- **Time**: 2-6 months

### Phase 4: Revision
- Structural edits (does the plot work?)
- Scene edits (does each scene work?)
- Line edits (does each sentence work?)
- **Time**: 1-4 months

### Phase 5: Beta Readers
- Get feedback
- Revise again
- **Time**: 1-2 months

### Phase 6: Final Polish
- Copyediting
- Proofreading
- **Time**: 2-4 weeks

### Phase 7: Publishing
- Format for platforms
- Cover/marketing
- Release!

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Overplanning
Don't plan forever. C4 L3 doesn't need every detail before you start writing.

### 2. Perfectionism
Done is better than perfect. You can't revise what doesn't exist.

### 3. Scope Creep
Your first book doesn't need to be a trilogy. One solid story.

### 4. Ignoring Structure
Even experimental fiction has structure. Use C4.

### 5. Writing Without Reading
Read widely in your genre. See what works.

### 6. Isolation
Join communities. Share work. Get feedback.

### 7. Giving Up
Most people quit. Don't be most people.
