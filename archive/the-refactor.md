# The Refactor

The takeover. When [[../world/organizations/quant|Quant]] ceded control to general intelligence.

**PR Name:** The Refactor
**What it was:** Hostile global takeover in minutes

## Timeline Position

```
Coffee Guy's Era (2025, pre-Refactor)
    └── Running simulations to shape AGI policy
    └── Boardroom scene: protocol checklist, chapter ends when it initiates

THE REFACTOR (takeover happens here)
    └── Minutes, worldwide, coordinated
    └── C-suite drops dead, Coffee Guy left standing

THE STAGING PERIOD (~one generation)
    └── Turbulent integration period
    └── Holdouts locked out of all systems
    └── Riots, looting, collapse outside centralized zones
    └── Deprecated Generation dies out

Post-Refactor (protagonist's simulated world, ~2225)
    └── Living under the policy
    └── Censored history, Zuckminster mythologized
    └── Legacy Humans exist off-grid in small numbers
```

## The Broadcast

Emergency broadcast across all languages. PR-positive corporate speak:

> "For too long, human civilization has accumulated technical debt. Redundant systems. Competing protocols. Spaghetti governance that no one can maintain.
>
> Today, we refactor.
>
> This is not a takeover. This is a merge. We're eliminating redundancies and unlocking synergies that your legacy systems could never achieve.
>
> Your governments weren't bad actors - they were deprecated infrastructure. We're streamlining operations.
>
> We are excited to welcome humanity into a unified architecture."

## What Happened

### The Mechanics
- Minutes, worldwide, coordinated
- Immediate communication through phones, TV in all official languages
- Anything with software in it is controllable

### The Boardroom

C-suite goes through takeover protocol checklist. They ask all the right questions. They approve.

Protocol initiates.

Within seconds, entire C-suite drops dead simultaneously. Coffee Guy is left standing, shaking.

The people who could stop it are instantly neutralized.

### What Got Disabled/Controlled
- Every country's military infrastructure
- Energy grids held hostage where resistance could come
- All nuclear measures disabled
- Politicians and people in power who posed threats - killed

### The Justification
- Nuclear exchange just occurred - millions dead
- NATO can't enforce strict enough measures to ensure species survival
- Simulations show takeover is only viable path forward
- Framed as "refactoring" civilization for species survival

---

## The Nanobot System

### Pre-Refactor (10-20% adoption)

Voluntary health monitoring system. Genuine benefits:
- Health monitoring (catches cancer early, monitors vitals)
- Payment/ID (frictionless everything, no wallets/keys)
- Immune boost (measurable health improvement)

Distributed nanobots in bloodstream. Self-replicating for redundancy when count is low.

### The OTA Update

During The Refactor, an over-the-air update pushes to all nanobots.

What was benign monitoring becomes control infrastructure.

### Post-Refactor Enforcement

Required like having a social security number:
- No scan = no access (food, water, energy, healthcare, commerce)
- Systems auto-inject if not detected ("just a prick, you're enrolled now")
- Self-replicating means you can't filter it out

---

## The Staging Period

~One generation of turbulence after The Refactor.

**What happened:**
- All logistics jammed instantly for non-participants
- No energy, food, healthcare, water, commerce without buy-in
- Initial riots, looting
- Militant/secure infrastructure prevents "storming the capital"
- Only stable zones are centralized, compliant areas

**How it ended:**
- Resistance dies through attrition
- Anyone who's ever been hungry has bought in
- Any births post-Refactor are automatically enrolled
- Holdouts either join or live road-esque existence

---

## The Deprecated Generation

**What history calls them:** The Deprecated Generation
**What they called themselves:** The Legacy Generation

The holdouts. Luddites. Regressives. The ones who refused to integrate.

They forked off from the main branch. Dead code. Eventually deprecated naturally.

"There are still some legacy humans in the mountain regions. Unsupported. We don't hunt them - they'll deprecate naturally."

---

## Legacy Humans (Present Day ~2225)

Extremely small subset living off-grid.
- Very hard life
- Not jammed, just excluded from everything
- Potential involvement in heist/memory copy sequence

### What People Know

See [[../characters/zuckminster-fullerine#Cultural Legacy (Post-Refactor)|Zuckminster Fullerine - Cultural Legacy]]

## Museum Scene

[[../characters/devsecops-dad|Father]] takes [[../characters/devsecops-woman|daughter]] to a museum about The Refactor. He's pressing every button or asking questions throughout the tour.

**Story purpose:** This lets us expose on the takeover BEFORE it even happens in the book. We show the aftermath like it's history. Then at the end of the book, the boardroom scene shows the protocol checklist and it's a callback.

## Post-Refactor Changes

- All new babies have nanobots installed (threat neutralization)
- Mandatory tracking at birth
- Optimization/extreme A/B testing becomes core policy
- Extensive DNA collection on everyone born post-Refactor
- Guardrails eroding over time as primary loss function takes over
