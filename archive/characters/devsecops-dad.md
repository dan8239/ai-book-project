Pressing every button or asking questions throughout the tour.

## Purpose in Story
This lets me expose on the takeover BEFORE it even happens in the book. I get to show the aftermath way before it happens, like it's history. Then at the end of the book, the first sequence in that takeover happens and it's like a memory / callback to exactly what happened in that moment.
