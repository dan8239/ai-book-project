# DevSecOps Woman

**Name:** TBD
**Gender:** Woman
**Age:** TBD
**Era:** [[../timeline/early-sim-era|Early Sim (~2125-2150)]]

## Role
Technically brilliant engineer who discovers the truth about the simulation and plants a message for future generations.

## The Discovery
She learned the truth via computer science method (not DNA analysis). See [[../mystery/devsecops-clues|her discovery path]] for details.

## Her Action
Spent **21 years planting backdoors**, then planted the origin dataset in DNA data as message/proof.

**Why she altered the data:** To leave proof of simulation for future generations - planted the actual origin dataset that bootstrapped the simulation, knowing the metadata would reveal the population bottleneck and demographic bias.

## Partner
- **Description:** Total normie (not technical)
- **Role:** Becomes her partner
- **Story function:** TBD - may or may not connect to protagonist

## Relationships
- **Relationship to [[protagonist|Protagonist]]:** TBD (may or may not be ancestor - thematic connection matters more)
- **Father:** [[devsecops-dad|DevSecOps's Father]] - lived through [[../timeline/the-refactor|The Refactor]], obsessed with the event

## Narrative Role

**Not a character arc** - a mystery to be uncovered.

### What we see:
- **Prologue:** Her final act - last day at work, planting the data
- **Easter eggs:** Data/logs throughout that show her trail (discovered by protagonist)

### What we learn:
- Who she was
- How she discovered the truth (via CS method, not DNA)
- Her 21-year backdoor campaign
- Why she planted the origin dataset

### Relationship to Protagonist
May or may not be his ancestor - doesn't really matter. The connection is thematic (both in the 0.3% who act), not necessarily genealogical.

### Structure
Her story is the ANSWER, not a journey we follow. Protagonist discovers breadcrumbs → pieces together what she did.
