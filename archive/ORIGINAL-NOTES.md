1. Overview
    1. Write from perspective of a data scientist slash Ai analyst and ml
    2. There is a key driving mystery that the character or characters are trying to solve. It's essentially that they're all in a simulation and their whole existence spans a few milliseconds in a quantum processing unit
2. Next steps
    1. Claude steps to writing and marketing this book via git
    2. Git repo with initial repo organization
        1. Every prompt is a commit message with a prompt number and description
        2. Log prompt and token counts
        3. Organize into these baskets to start then ask claude for help on the rest
    3. Substack medium Twitter? Whatever else has articles
    4. Character dev
3. Themes
    1. We are all snapshots in time
    2. Eventually those snapshots are all captured by society historically
    3. Ai and machine leaning use those snapshots to start controlling and govering directly
4. General plot
    1. data scientist is studying biological data over many many generations
    2. It's written with actual psychology facts (thinking fast and slow style).
    3. The scientists are running really clever tests to discover these things
    4. These organisms are the protagonists
        1. They are a romantic interest and have their own ups and downs
            1. Make that about kids and trauma
    5. Could just tell as parallel streams so it's not obvious that one is studying the other
    6. At the end of the movie the organism thats being studied turns out to be human
    7. The scientists are figuring out shit archaeologocally
    8. They're talking about the past
    9. The psychology is real and active for today's human
    10. At the end it's revealed that humans are the species being studied not the ones writing the book
    11. The difference is like homo sapiens vs Neanderthal
    12. The only delta is Ai between these species
        1. How do they differentiate?
5. Questions to answer
    1. The big mystery?
        1. What are they studying
        2. Why is a simulation needed
        3. Why is it a genetic algorithm that's best suited to the problem
        4. What is the loss function that led to us optimizing like this?
            1. Energy capture?
            2. Survival of DNA?
            3. Interstellar travel?
        5. Who's at the top of the pyramid running it all?
            1. Is this still a human?
        6. Why does it need to be recursive or repeating?
        7. How does the simulation realism / granularity change?
            1. Nested and getting more primative each iteration?
            2. Or equal memory requirements but spinning up the next instance after x epochs
                1. Trials are humans, epochs are generations?
                2. Akin to the big bang repeating itself. It's either recursive or repeating or both
        8. How do generations and epochs work?
            1. Hard reset?
            2. Rolling generations (like our lives)
            3. Infinite very similar simulations or whole populations?
            4. How to isolate those selected from general population?
                1. This is just the data test
                2. Each simulation just has a few thousand types with a real avenue to even get selected
        9. How does selection work?
            1. What are we optimizing for on a per trial basis?
            2. Is this just leadership and energy consolidation?
            3. Aligned energy consolidation (one thought with ability to pull off)
    2. How did we get here?
        1. How did all the data get captured
        2. How did the creatures studying become decouple from the data?
            1. Perhaps it appears to the protagonist that they're studying archeological or old server biological data
            2. That's how they start studying this data
            3. Some pretense for finding a pre qpu server from a biological company. Think 23 and me but it has data over an evolutionary biology relevant scale of time
                1. Start the book like this
        3. This has happened before and will again
            1. The decoupling isn't real. It's not real archeological data.
            2. The data is actually the previous species generation, and the new species spawns a bunch of data scientists in simulations to study the evolution and goal
            3. The first species was our real biological data
            4. It's a recursive genetic algorithm that goes deeper and deeper
            5. Once it understands the behavioral shifts it understands incentives better?
                1. Each trial optimizes for loss function
                2. Each epoch adjusts intermediate loss functions
                    1. Think setting kpis for okrs
    3. Limiting factor of memory, how many peoples brains and circumstances could be copied?
        1. Quantum computing ingredients?
6. Style notes
    1. Timestamp each chapter where relevant
        1. Is there a way to make it not obvious at all how fast it's going at first?
        2. Then unbelievably obvious after that
            1. Perhaps just numbers at first
            2. Stylistically like milliseconds nomenclature but just dots between
                1. 0.217.293.294
                2. Emoji?
                3. How to do chapters and keep timestamp thing
            3. Final chapter full in the units and print out the total time of that humans life
                1. Print out trial time
                2. Print out number of humans remaining in the trial generation / epoch
    2. Use the cutting edge of ml what you've learned and push it a smidge
        1. Chatgpt needs to give me related Ai ml concepts that are actually real that are similar to these concepts
        2. Have it read some white papers and explain them with this in mind
        3. Learn about quantum computing and more importantly what it could unlock if we #spared no expense
    3. What if planet of the apes was more subtle?
    4. Just write the whole book with Ai tomorrow its so meta and zeitgeist its the whole point
        1. Claude code and git commit the entire thing
        2. Markdown files for every single step
        3. Every character theme plot etc captured in markdown
        4. Just use claude code
        5. Spend 3 weekends or so
        6. Use github for changes
        7. Get big picture and settings and themes and resolutions of every scene
        8. Fix or redirect any clunky dialogue
        9. Use c4 architecture to break up the story. Bit plot, system level, module level, chapter level, dialog level
        10. Decide a story arch to use
7. Scene ideas
    1. lecture by a doctor or Ted talk esque setting? Maybe he's taking some courses you can splice in?
        1. Each evolution Al step can be a few different papers
        2. Different papers can disagree just like dinosaur skeletons
        3. Benefit of the doubt of differing arguments for reasons of behavior
    2. Discovery of the old cpu or data set?
        1. Could just be the first real occurance
        2. Could just be a set up from the start
        3. Could be unclear
    3. Mystery unraveling
        1. The data itself hides a clue in the code
        2. Something that could only be intentionally placed there
        3. Have to check all the other possibilities at a terminal to eliminate all other possibilities
            1. Show the claude work low here to FLY through
            2. Debugger mode shows logs
                1. Not that many logs dipshit give me the good shit
            3. Claude has a legit funny personality
                1. Just say all he funniest shit with the robot terminal
                2. Calling me the dipshit like I'm the bottleneck here?
                    1. It will swear and just have no filter
                    2. Not hacky like sevro actually clever
        4. Think Watergate or other books where a hidden message is passed for someone to find in the future
            1. This message is super hard to catch technically
            2. It has certain requirements for competence to even get to the initial message
                1. This set of hurdles to clear is meticulously designed
                2. It filters out more importantly than allowing in
                3. Talk about the Nigerian prince scam emails
                4. What requirements? Pull together people who
                    1. Access to people (energy)
                    2. What else would be necessary here?
                5. Only 1 out of 10000 will pass those checklists
            3. Similar requirements for the other evolutionary selections to get there
                1. Not just data scientists
                2. The other folks are leaders, Engineers, philosophers, marketers, etc.
            4. The message reveals and proves the presence of a larger mystery
            5. The person who wrote it is persecuted and killed presumably
                1. In the end this is just the optimal method of rite of passage for several psychological reasons
                2. Attracts certain personality traits
                3. Fosters isolation or teamwork or something?
                4. Delusions of grandeur
                5. It's the loss function that found this method after x trials and epochs in the end but we don't know that yet
    4. Final selection
        1. The final selection exits the main loop
            1. Could be forward propagation, loss calculation,
            2. Backpropogation, etc as the sections of the book
            3. Learn the steps of nsgaI
        2. Once the person dies epoch finishes and we get almost an afterlife
            1. This is where we breed the next generation
            2. Perhaps the book has gone through a couple of generations
            3. This is the end of the epoch where it all starts over
            4. He gets chosen for the select group who decides the adjustment to the loss function
            5. Delusions of grandeur but there are infinite more epochs and they just breed to the next rolling epoch
        3. In the end the humans choose if they want to participate or not as part of the selection
            1. What do they get if they get rewarded?
            2. Again one in 10 million simulations chooses the loss function path
            3. This specific instance of human and circumstances has chosen no 2762639 times
            4. Finally this one says yes
    5. Invited to a football game
        1. The sports psychology stuff is just the test suite.
            1. It evaluates that changes aren't breaking changes
            2. There are discussions in git PRs to decide when to pursue
            3. Sports still exist they're just remnants of test suites
            4. It's like reinforcement learning
        2. Gives this whole theory about how we still select that way
            1. Why select for big tits when they don't pass genetically?
            2. It's not the tits we're passing down and selecting for it's the wealth. You know a lot of poor people with fake tits? If fake tits become cheap the next fetish is going to be unfathomably expensive
    6. Book starts
        1. The guy who is frantically putting the message is doing it
        2. It's not clear that it's a message at any point
        3. He has to go through extreme lengths to hide this and still allow it to get through the next generation
        4. Redundant copies, block chain esque technology
        5. How would you even change the ledger?
        6. What signs would be left behind?
        7. It results either in certain death or he pulls it off and commits suicide since it doesn't matter and he only risks being caught
            1. The suicide has to look like an accident to not draw suspicion
        8. He's been working towards this goal for like 21 years
            1. Putting in back doors to every system he built for decades
            2. Built it right into the company template
            3. Just shoved it into an orb that gets reused everywhere
            4. It's the cluster image template
            5. Right down to the firmware maybe? Depends where you need to get to to reliably change a ledger
            6. He's a devsecops guy who knows everything
            7. Jaded disgruntled but pleasaNt to everyone
    7. Simulation talk / debate with someone really frigging smart. Could end the book here. It could go back to the devsecops guy right before he planted the message
        1. Historians are in charge of cataloging human history in data
            1. They compress normies into summary data (600TB > 3.4 GB)
            2. Get a realistic amount of memory here
            3. May need to do cubits
        2. The celebrities are more notable and get more data captured
        3. It starts with better data collection
        4. A shot at birth that has the tracking data that started being mandated at some 3 decimal place Timestamp
        5. Then all the biological and synapse data is available
        6. Celebrities evolved because capturing all data is A recursive problem
            1. You capture everything
            2. The data gets more granular so more data required
            3. You capture all of that data
            4. The power increases due to néw sensors
                1. They're sensors not tracking devices
            5. You can't capture all the data so there's an energy conservation limitation
            6. You decide to just copy data from top K celebrities
            7. K actually varies by a logarithmic relationship
            8. More population growth of celebrity shared knowledge doesn't increase as much
            9. Celebrity begets leadership begets energy consolidation
            10. Politicians go into politics because they want to be famous
            11. Nobody gets famous because they want to get into politics
    8. Loss function talk
        1. What is a loss function
        2. Capitalism is one
        3. Communism is one
        4. You must boil these down to their optimization algorithm
        5. Capitalism and Communism are related
            1. They're humanist
            2. They're the same shit
        6. What about religion
            1. What is this optimizing for?
        7. Go through a bunch somehow
        8. This might be a lecture or homework with claude code conversations
        9. Turn in the paper and that's how you get the job with the data
    9. Waymo bike tech
        1. Waymo bike is all electric
        2. Humans get in and ride but there's a bike or row machine in there
        3. They get paid for kwh produced
        4. Is row or bike config more efficient?
        5. What $ per watt will we be at by then?
        6. Just make inflation absurd like pesos
        7. The tech stops at wherever biology stopped
        8. The number of 1-2 person riders are perfectly optimized
        9. Personal vehicles are absurdly pricey
        10. Public transportation just became insanely efficient it never went to the air
        11. It's not efficient to transport 200 lb things through the air that's why we walked and you don't see a bunch of 300 lb birds
    10. Guy periodically checking status of the simulation drinking coffee boring as shit
        1. Super short chapters?
        2. They need to have a point not just spoil it
8. Characters
    1. Devsecops old guy
        1. Plants the initial message
        2. First guy to figure it out (or most common starter of the revolution)
            1. Does this just happen every epoch slightly differently?
        3. Most likely outcomes when he finds out (32% of the time)
            1. 89% he finds out and does nothing of note
                1. Work
                2. Family
                3. God

    2. The person (or recursive Sim) who is studying the data set and unveiling the mystery
        1. Protagonist
        2. Technology builder
        3. Maybe dual track?
            1. Write it like home life work life?
            2. These are just two instances with different outcomes in the end
    3. Someone who laments the loss of so many civilizations
        1. Navajo
        2. Actual Egyptians
        3. Carthage
        4. Etc
    4. Claude assistant
        1. Excuse for spouting facts
        2. Protagonist answers their own inner monologue a ton here
        3. Hilarious
        4. Use for non sequiters or philosophical stuff
        5. Protagonist talks through how they set it up and trained it
        6. On its entire past interaction and chat history
        7. Learned mys sense of humor from what I laughed at and sentiment feedback from all my interactions and communications
        8.  (make like 6 of these based on task)
            1. "Let me talk to Glenn Robinson you're pissing me off"
        9. Spin off more instances once or twice. Ask for names of sports athletes whose nicknames could be sexual innuendo
            1. Big dog
            2. Big hurt
            3. Big unit
            4. Sir Charles
            5.
9. Notes to sort still
    1. In the end it's Ai doing the study
        1. These are still characters with human like motivations
        2. Almost just write it like an unfeeling psycho
        3. They just operate their entire existence in a few minutes of compute
    2. In the end I the whole interaction took place in like 32 mins because Ai did the research
        1. Timestamps first and last chapter
        2. This is just something looking into the data of those researchers life
    3. Each human instance is just a trial of an evolutionary algorithm
    4. All human instances interconnected by network and share information that way
    5. Chapters are just "content" with some Timestamp and execution id's
    6. Garbage collection
        1. Data can't be collected everywhere so it has to be pruned
        2. Wiping out records of human existence that are no longer required
        3. Could be some mystery here that needs solving?
    7. Whole thing a giant A/B test?
        1. Run lola run type dual tracks?
