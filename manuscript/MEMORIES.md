[TO BE ADDED from Google Doc]

_Examples of what to capture:_
- Funny observations about fish
- Questions kids ask
- Way kids name things
- Non sequiturs
- Sweet moments

### Emotional Arc

**First scene:**
- Normal parenting moment
- Protagonist present but distracted by work
- Simple joy, routine life
- Foreshadowing: fish in tank = humans in simulation

**Last scene:**
- Same dialogue, same actions
- Protagonist now knows: kid might not be "real" in traditional sense
- Kid might get compressed/vectorized
- Protagonist chooses this moment anyway
- The choice: go home and hang with family despite knowing the truth

### Integration Notes
- Use real kid speech patterns for authenticity
- Don't explain the metaphor - let it land
- Keep it grounded and domestic
- The mundane becomes profound
