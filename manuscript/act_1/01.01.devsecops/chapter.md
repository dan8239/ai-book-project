# Chapter 1: Devsecops (Title TBD)

## Chapter Goals

What the reader should learn/feel:
- Devsecops woman is technically brilliant
- She learned the truth about the simulation (via compsci method - TBD how)
- She spent 21 years planting backdoors
- She plants the origin dataset in DNA records as proof/message
- The dataset reveals: 100% of population from biased subsample, demographic impossibility, proof of simulation
- She plants the computerized discovery to be "found" archaeologically
- She meets normie partner (protagonist's other ancestor, last name lineage)
- She's part of the 0.3% who act
- Time period: Dozens of generations before protagonist (early in simulation)

## Moments

### MOMENT: Planting the Archaeological Discovery
- Plants the computerized discovery in terrain map
- Only map access that isn't heavily rendered and obvious to manipulate
- Places it in location that will be excavated in next few hundred years
- Does this across all simulations (shows up in every trial)
- Makes it look like archaeological discovery when actually planted deliberately
- Guarantees it will be "discovered" naturally during future excavation

### MOMENT: [Other moments TBD]

## Notes
- The terrain map backdoor is key - it's less monitored than other simulation systems
- By placing it in scheduled excavation site, discovery is guaranteed
- Cross-simulation placement means it appears in all trials, not just one
