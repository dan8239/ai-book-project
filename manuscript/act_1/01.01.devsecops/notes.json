    "The dataset reveals: 100% of population from biased subsample, demographic impossibility, proof of simulation",
    "She plants the computerized discovery to be 'found' archaeologically",
    "She meets normie partner (protagonist's other ancestor, last name lineage)",
    "She's part of the 0.3% who act",

        "Does this across all simulations (shows up in every trial)",
