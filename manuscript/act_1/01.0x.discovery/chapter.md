# Chapter X: Discovery (Title TBD)

## Chapter Goals

What the reader should learn/feel:
- Protagonist is deep in optimization work, making progress
- The scale of the colony mission: thousands of shuttles, each optimized for different planetary conditions
- Success rates are brutally low (best case: 11.3% survival)
- Some modified humans are barely recognizable as human
- Establish constraints protagonist works within (can't optimize everything)
- In scheduled dump time, he starts poking around ancient discovery data
- Discovers he can access raw data from ancient civilization
- This is the hook that starts the mystery investigation

## Moments

### MOMENT 1: Optimization Work in Progress
- Show him working on simulated reproduction and death rates
- Constraints he's optimizing within:
  - Breeding limits
  - Resource constraints
  - Self-replicating AI robot speed
- Dashboards showing survival rate for each shuttle
- Different planets pose different problems
  - Some fairly easy: survival rates up to 11.3%
  - Most much worse
- Success rate metrics:
  - Average reproductive rates based on population
  - Resources available
  - Chance of genetic deform
  - Chance of hazardous conditions (still quite small for survival overall)
- NOTE: Don't beat dead horse about humanizing gene pool - it's success rates and reproductive rates

### MOMENT 2: Frustration with Constraints
- Can't optimize initial material for self-replicating machines
- Can't optimize parallelization of the machines
- These are fixed constraints he has to work within

### MOMENT 3: The Shuttle Requirements
- Thousands of shuttles being prepared
- Minimal material needed for each:
  - Navigation
  - Solar sail
  - Self-replication from material on planet
  - Self-replicating resource gathering
  - More self-replication
  - Life support systems (if needed)
  - Housing
  - DNA modification for local biomes
  - Setting loose of local bacteria onto planet
  - Terraforming processes (as needed)

### MOMENT 4: DNA Modification for Planetary Conditions
- DNA selections suited to specific conditions:
  - Gravity
  - Temperature
  - Atmospheric balance
  - [Other planetary variables]
- Some modifications are extreme
- Some of these species are pretty close to not human by the end
- Still technically human, but adapted for radically different environments

### MOMENT 5: Ancient Discovery Investigation
- During scheduled dump time (the free time he fights for)
- Finally reads the ancient discovery article
- Starts poking around the data
- Figures out he can get raw data from ancient civilization
- This is something interesting, worth investigating further

## Notes
- This chapter shows protagonist doing actual work, not just setup
- Establishes the brutal reality of colony missions (low success rates)
- Shows how far humanity is willing to modify itself for survival
- Ends with hook into mystery: access to ancient civilization raw data
- This sets up investigation in following chapters

## Open Questions
- What chapter number is this? (depends on pacing)
- What specific planetary conditions make good examples?
- How much technical detail on optimization?
- What does the ancient data interface look like?
