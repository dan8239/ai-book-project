# Chapter 2: The Aquarium

## Chapter Goals

What the reader should learn/feel:
- Establish protagonist's family life (kids, wife he loves)
- Domestic normalcy and warmth
- Set up mirror for ending (aquarium scene will bookend the story)
- Protagonist is pre-occupied with work at moments
- Introduce the central question: "What are you optimizing for?"
- Transition from home life to work life
- Establish his job: evolutionary psychology/economics researcher

## Moments

### MOMENT 1: Aquarium Scene
- Opening with kid in their room
- Naming fish together
- Talking about room stuff (reference family-memories.txt for dialogue inspiration)
- Domestic normalcy, father-child connection

### MOMENT 2: Transition to Work
- Shift from home to work environment
- [TBD: How does he get to work? Walk? Automated transport?]

### MOMENT 3: Opening Question
- Partner/colleague asks: "What are you optimizing for?"
- Protagonist explains his work: evolutionary psych/economics research
- Working on: how cooperation/empathy evolved, DNA markers, genetic patterns
- Introduce archaeological CPU plant with 'wild' pre-consolidation DNA data
- Reveal world through work: optimization culture, tracking, meritocracy, resource constraints, Idaho desert setting

## Open Questions
- What exactly is protagonist optimizing? (specific loss function)
- What genetic parameters matter?
- Who is partner character?
- Time of day? Environmental details?
- What's on screen?
