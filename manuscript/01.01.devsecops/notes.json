    "She plants the origin dataset in DNA records as proof/message",
    "The dataset reveals: 100% of population from biased subsample, demographic impossibility, proof of simulation",
    "She plants the computerized discovery to be 'found' archaeologically",
    "She meets normie partner (protagonist's other ancestor, last name lineage)",
    "She's part of the 0.3% who act",

        "Does this across all simulations (shows up in every trial)",

        "Her dad lived through the consolidation event - obsessed with it like WWII dads today",
        "It's somewhat too distant to really feel and remember but you hear stories",
        "He's divorced from his wife, is pressing every button or asking questions throughout the tour",
        "She's basically going around because she doesn't see her dad much",
        "He's happy just to see his daughter",
        "The guide / voice will kind of rattle on as her dad presses buttons",
        "They walk through each of the takeover events like a timeline in a somewhat natural way",
        "The museum has old company logos from before, and descriptions of how things were",
        "Just talking about what they find about the way we live today as unusual will be telling about the current day situation",
        "This exposes the takeover aftermath before it happens in the book - shows it like history",
        "At the end of the book the first sequence in that takeover happens - callback/memory to exactly what happened in that moment",

    "The terrain map backdoor is key - it's less monitored than other simulation systems",
