What's locked in. Last updated: 2025-09-29

## 1. World Mechanics

### 1.1 The Simulation Structure
- Protagonist exists on the FIRST simulation layer
- Entire existence spans milliseconds in a quantum processing unit (QPU)
- Recursive: each layer of AI studies the previous generation
- Started with real human biological/historical data (23andMe-style company)
- Multiple layers exist below the first layer (protagonist's layer)

#### Why Recursive Layers Exist
The company coffee guy works for aims to find humanity's golden path. By letting the simulations themselves try to figure that out:
- More extreme edge cases can be explored than in the current real-life scenario
- First layer models modern day life accurately (policy changes to current population)
- Nested layers enable emergent behavior and more extreme simulations
- Higher percentage of population can be devoted to solving the problem
- Moral considerations are one layer removed
- Entire nested populations can work on KPIs derived from main OKRs
- Less directly tied to top-level simulation

### 1.2 The Real World (Coffee Guy's Layer)
- Essentially present day but AI significantly more advanced
- Quantum tech advancements: memory solved, enables realistic simulations
- More energy efficient simulation (research needed: realistic implementation and advantages)
- Resource crisis: severe pressure on food, water, energy
- Desertification: much more desert-like areas
- 23andMe-style company collected biological/behavioral data over evolutionary timescales
- That data seeded the first simulation layer
- Time compression: Coffee guy's total chapter time = one day while entire simulation runs

### 1.3 Technology (In-Simulation)
- Mandatory tracking shot at birth (started at some timestamp in history)
- Quantum computing exists
- Data preservation has memory constraints
- Celebrities/leaders get more detailed simulation than general population

### 1.4 The Simulation Data
- 847+ million trials run
- Median extinction: 127 years (most die between 75-150 years)
- Peak death zone: civilizations with nukes/AI/climate crisis but lacking coordination
- 0.04% survive past 500 years (the golden path)
- Success requires hitting 5 critical decision points correctly (combined probability: ~0.04%)

### 1.5 Memory and Epochs
- NO memory persistence between iterations
- Protagonist doesn't remember previous 2,762,639 refusals
- No déjà vu, dreams, or "feeling" from past runs
- Works like actual genetic algorithms (each trial is fresh)
- Epochs last until humanity kills itself OR prospers beyond reasonable extinction
- Could be decades, centuries, millennia of simulated time (outcome-based, not time-based)

## 2. The Optimization System

### 2.1 The Loss Function

**Ultimate Goal:** DNA propagation and survival across cosmic timescales

**Hierarchy:**
1. Survival (food, shelter, safety - Maslow's base)
2. Organization (religion, politics, nations - prevent chaos at scale)
3. Energy & Peaceful Consolidation (avoid self-annihilation while growing) ← novel's focus
4. Interstellar Expansion (Kardashev scale, reach the stars)

**Current Epoch's Primary KPI:** Aligned energy consolidation without self-destruction

### 2.2 Why Full Lifetimes
Optimization happens at multiple timescales:
- Per-trial: Individual human life outcomes
- Per-generation: NSGA-II style selection from multiple trials
- Per-epoch: Adjustment to intermediate loss functions (KPIs)

Can't shortcut—complexity emerges over full lifetime.

### 2.3 The Selection Mechanism

**When epoch completes:**
1. Selected individuals are pulled out
2. Veil is removed—they learn they were in simulation
3. They're shown their stats (including iteration count)
4. They're offered the choice

**The Choice:**
- Join optimization layer: Help adjust loss functions for next epoch, influence KPIs
- Get reset: Tossed back in when RAM clears, no memory, run again

**Selection Criteria:**
- Leadership ability
- Energy/resource consolidation
- Long-term thinking
- Will they act when they discover truth? (0.3% test)

**Statistics:**
- 89% do nothing after discovering truth
- 10.7% self-destruct
- 0.3% act

**Purpose:** Selected individuals become the mechanism for adjusting optimization—review what worked/failed, adjust intermediate loss functions, set parameters for next generation. This is how the system self-optimizes.

**The Dark Question:** Is the optimization layer real, or just another simulation layer? (Turtles all the way up)

## 3. Characters

### 3.1 Protagonist
- Data scientist / AI analyst / ML specialist
- In-simulation (doesn't know it until selection)
- Has romantic interest (relationship has ups/downs, involves kids/trauma)
- Works with Claude assistant(s)
- This instance has chosen "no" 2,762,639 times previously
- This time chooses "yes"

### 3.2 Devsecops Guy
- Old, technically brilliant
- Spent 21 years planting backdoors in systems
- Plants message in the data
- Part of the 0.3% who act on discovering simulation truth
- In-simulation

### 3.3 Coffee Guy
- Real world (outside simulation)
- Reviews simulation results
- Generates reports with histograms and golden path recommendations
- Delivers to decision-makers who ignore them

### 3.4 Claude Assistant(s)
- AI assistants with personality
- Swear, have no filter
- Multiple instances with different names (athlete nicknames)
- Trained on protagonist's interaction history

## 4. The Story

### 4.1 Structure: TRIAL / LOSS / ADJUSTMENT

**PART I: TRIAL**
- Protagonist lives in simulation
- Discovers anomaly in GeneSys data
- Follows mystery
- Investigative, human-scale problem-solving

**PART II: LOSS**
- Learns truth about simulation
- Sees 847M trials, 99.96% extinction rate
- Memory compression event (loved ones disappear)
- Offered selection

**PART III: ADJUSTMENT**
- Granted experiment access (MLflow-style)
- Sees Pareto front and constraint violations
- Coffee guy story fully revealed
- Makes choice (attempt 2,762,640)

### 4.2 The Message
- Hidden in biological/archaeological dataset (actually 23andMe-style data)
- Protagonist thinks it's archaeological (old server they found)
- Requires specific competencies to discover
- Uses Nigerian prince logic (filters more than it allows)
- Contains proof that simulation exists

### 4.3 Narrative POV
- First-person (protagonist POV)
- Possible Station Eleven influences (time jumps, style mixing)
- Coffee guy interludes TBD

## 5. Themes
- We are all snapshots in time
- All data eventually gets captured and studied
- AI uses behavioral snapshots to govern
- Loss functions as ideology
- Recursive optimization

## 6. Style
- Timestamps at chapter breaks (ambiguous at first, revealed as milliseconds later)
- Hard sci-fi with real ML concepts
- Funny/dark tone balance (via Claude assistant character)
- Meta: book written with AI about AI simulation
