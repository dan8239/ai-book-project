# User Decisions Audit
## Checking what has a home vs what's missing

### ‚úÖ IN WORLD.JSON
- Simulation structure (real world pre-takeover, protagonist's world post-consolidation)
- 847M trials, 0.04% success rate
- Optimization goal (minimize extinction, not maximize survival)
- Golden path = nursery pods (end state, not opening)
- Loss function hierarchy (4 levels, focus on Energy & Consolidation)
- Selection mechanism (89%/10.7%/0.3% statistics)
- No memory between iterations
- 2,762,640 attempts, this one chooses yes
- Characters: protagonist (evolutionary psych), devsecops (21 years backdoors), coffee guy, Claude assistants
- Archaeological CPU plant = "wild" humans data
- Company filters results to show only THEIR takeover

### ‚úÖ IN OUTLINE.JSON
- Three acts: TRIAL / LOSS / ADJUSTMENT
- Scene 1: Devsecops (how he learns truth TBD, why alters DNA TBD)
- Scene 2: Protagonist intro, "What are you optimizing for?"
- Act 2 beats: learns truth, memory compression, offered selection
- Act 3 beats: MLflow access, Pareto front, company filter reveal, makes choice

### ‚ùå MISSING - Need homes for:

**Themes (user explicitly stated these):**
- "We are all snapshots in time"
- "All data eventually gets captured and studied"
- "AI uses behavioral snapshots to govern"
- "Loss functions as ideology"
- "Recursive optimization"
- The reports no one reads (coffee guy generates, ignored)
- 0.3% who act (vs 89% do nothing, 10.7% self-destruct)
- Horror of success (prosperous world built on moral violations)

**Motifs:**
- Timestamps at chapter breaks (ambiguous, revealed as milliseconds later)
- Nigerian prince logic (message filters more than allows)
- 21 years of backdoors (patience, long-term thinking)
- Memory compression (loved ones disappear)
- Celebrities get more detailed simulation than regular people
- "Wild" humans (baseline before optimization)
- Archaeological vs actual (protagonist misunderstands what data is)

**Meta elements:**
- Book written with AI about AI simulation
- Claude assistants: swear, no filter, athlete nicknames, dark humor
- Hard sci-fi with real ML concepts (NSGA-II, MLflow, Pareto front)
- Funny/dark tone balance

**Story mechanics:**
- First-person POV
- Station Eleven influences (time jumps, style mixing)
- Coffee guy interludes TBD

**World depth:**
- Recursive layers BELOW first layer (protagonist's layer has sub-simulations)
- Why recursive layers exist (explore edge cases, moral distance, KPI delegation)
- Quantum tech details (memory solved, energy efficient)
- 5 critical decision points (combined probability ~0.04%)

**Pareto front details:**
- Golden path violates moral constraints
- Specifically: genocide, bodily autonomy violations, democratic consent removed
- Success requires crossing lines 99.96% of simulations won't cross

**Protagonist's world - what feels normal but isn't:**
- Reproductive licensing/genetic screening
- Job assignment by aptitude (can't choose career)
- Information curation (history rewritten, before-times forgotten)
- Resource allocation by algorithm (no market, no luxury)
- Surveillance total (tracking shot, predictive policing, thought crime)
- Violence prediction/preemption
- No concept of nations, just zones
- Innovation directed only toward survival goals

**The message:**
- Hidden in biological/archaeological dataset
- Protagonist thinks it's archaeological (old server they found)
- Requires specific competencies to discover
- Nigerian prince logic (filters more than allows)
- Contains proof simulation exists

**Coffee guy's world specifics:**
- Resource pressure visible (water, energy, food)
- Desertification
- How to show scarcity subtly?

### ü§î CONTRADICTIONS OR UNCLEAR:
- Nursery pods: Opening scene? Or end state after consolidation?
  - **RESOLVED**: End state, NOT opening scene
- Protagonist's opening optimization: Nursery pod genetics? Or evolutionary psych baseline work?
  - **USER SAID**: Evolutionary psych work, studying "wild" humans
- Idaho desert: Coffee guy's world or protagonist's world?
  - **RESOLVED**: Protagonist's world
- Consolidation: Already happened in protagonist's time? Or at cusp in coffee guy's time?
  - **USER SAID**: Pre-takeover in coffee guy's time (company building justification), already happened in protagonist's time

### üìã OPEN QUESTIONS (User knows these need answers):
- How does devsecops learn the truth?
- Why does he alter the DNA record?
- What exactly did he plant?
- What is the consolidation event called?
- Protagonist's name, gender, age?
- Who is the partner character?
- What specific loss function in opening scene?
- How far into Act 1 before anomaly discovered?
- What does anomaly look like?
- What makes it worth investigating?
