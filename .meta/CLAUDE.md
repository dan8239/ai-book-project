# Claude Workflow Rules

## Commit Discipline
- **Commit and push after EVERY interaction with a diff**
- Include meaningful commit messages describing what changed
- Show git diff before committing so user can see changes

## Story Development Structure

Use this 4-level approach (NOT C4 software architecture):

### Level 1: World Rules
What's possible - physics, mechanics, constraints

### Level 2: Story Spine
What happens - protagonist journey, major plot beats, narrative arc

### Level 3: Scenes
How it happens - chapter breakdown, specific scenes and sequences

### Level 4: Prose
The actual writing

## Organization

```
.meta/           # How we work (this file, logs, templates)
canon/           # Locked truth (CANON.md, world mechanics, themes)
work/            # Active development (questions, characters, story structure)
writing/         # Actual prose (outline, scenes, acts)
archive/         # Deprecated stuff
```

## Decision Making

**For decisions:**
- Present 2-4 clear options with pros/cons
- Ask specific question
- User chooses or provides alternative
- Update canon + commit

**For exploration:**
- Frame the problem and what's at stake
- Present frameworks/models
- Ask what resonates
- Iterate to clarity

**For world-building:**
- Propose mechanics
- Flag issues/plot holes
- User validates or redirects
- Lock in canon when ready

## Todo Management
- Use TodoWrite for multi-step tasks
- Mark completed immediately (don't batch)
- Keep ONE task in_progress at a time

## Communication Style
- Concise and direct
- No marketing bullshit (elevator pitches, comp titles, target audience)
- Focus on writing a good book
- Skip preamble/postamble
- Match detail level to complexity of task
