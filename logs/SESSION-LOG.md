### Prompt 1
**User**: OK, go to my ai-book-project. read my initial git commit prompt and use the context there to read my notion notes and let's get to work

**Commit**: d0d5dc9
**Files Modified**: (initial organization, previous session)

---

### Prompt 2
**User**: I just did option B and it didn't work. I guess i'll just paste. Here they are! Please read them carefully, twice. I organized my thought in slightly different ways than your folder structure. [NOTION NOTES PASTED]

### Prompt 3
**User**: OK, let's adjust your behavior a bit. I appreciate your prolific nature but I can't think and answer a billion questions at once. Let's focus a bit and talk through each issue. I need you to be on top of notes and maintaining our c4 thought process. I want to have quick iterations so feel free to churn through the data and make notes, but let's systematically zoom into one piece at a time. There's a difference between canon and options and I'm still thinking through best way to piece them together.

**Commit**: (behavior updates, not committed separately)

---

### Prompt 4
**User**: Please put in your notes to always provide some of my own words as context to your question. Also, we have a ton of prompts and diffs that aren't captured as commits like I asked. I don't see a remote repo in git. I want the WHOLE process commit tracked on EVERY iteration or file change.

**Commit**: 8c57e9d (updated behavior guidelines)

---

### Prompt 5
**User**: I checked in another terminal I have installed git and restarted claude after doing git mcp. Here's the remote repo I just created https://github.com/dan8239/ai-book-project.git

**Action**: Added remote, pushed to GitHub (after removing sensitive tokens from history)

---

### Prompt 6
**User**: Can you bring in more of my notes from my original outline? Please save the original notes somewhere by the way. I need to be reminded of my thoughts. ANything in that section or anywhere I'm talking about optimization / loss function

**Commit**: 63f5c59
**Files Modified**:
- docs/ORIGINAL-NOTES.md (created - full original notes preserved)
- narrative/world/LOSS-FUNCTION-DEEP-DIVE.md (created)
- docs/CANON.md (updated with loss function canon)

### Prompt 7
**User**: I don't know yet. I think ultimately I haven't thought of the human emotional side but I think the human side is why they want to do it. Something you mentioned I wanted to dig in on that I liked [quoted epoch duration section]. We need to track all of these trials. This is like golden path in Dune where it literally tracks our extinction events. Ultimately this is like a giant optimization / monte carlo of our ways to salvation. A quick aside I think the coffee drinking analyst could be core to real human decisionmaking at the top levels of government. At the end of the movie they have the path forward and the action items how we get there and the humans just do the wrong thing because some asshat is in charge who doesn't read it

**Commit**: 3153779
**Files Modified**:
- narrative/world/EPOCH-TRACKING-AND-GOLDEN-PATH.md (created)
- narrative/world/SIMULATION-DATA-ANALYSIS.md (created)
- docs/CANON.md (updated with real world vs simulation structure)

**Token Count**: ~3500

### Prompt 8
**User**: I mean't to say when it's being tracked. Like x percent of our civilizations died out within y years. What would this histogram look like? Let's get a realistic curve and we're optimizing for the long tail. I'd love to show an actual histogram at the end of the book showing the survival rates and extinction reasons. Also, average survival duration grouped by extinction level event, etc. Literally let's make some synthetic data for the simulation that makes the optimization exercise make sense. The protagonist and story are all in-simulation people. The 23 and me data is an origin story for the simulation and serves as a believable pretext for this recursive simulation. The real world is just the very near future where we still drink coffee and do work at computers

**Commit**: (same as above, contained in 3153779)

---

### Prompt 9
**User**: Great. Let's throw some error bars on it for validity if we can justify it. Another piece I want to dig in on is the old server. It should feel like we're further in the future than we are. The protagonist is studying data from an old server in an archaeological site. This is all made up in the simulation as pretext for... some reason? Why recursion? Let's answer that later. But the general feel is almost like the tech team for a revelation space esque study of our ancient ancestors. I need to figure out why the simulation has this level of misdirection, it needs to be a catalyst for selection or benefit the loss function somehow. I have some notes in the original about why this could be (attracts certain personality types, etc.?) I need a valid reason it seems flimsy

### Prompt 10
**User**: Yes, a little bit. Let's talk through reasons for devsecops planting. I dont have a good feel for how the selection happens or what the tests the protagonist is passing. I almost feel like it's a series of hurdles for the protagonist that ultimately are the "selection" step in NSGAII that allows breeding and advancement of the gene pool or perhaps just of the policy changes. Maybe the policies are essentially open source commits by that time. Anyway, x% of these trials a devsecops guy plants evidence into a blockchain esque ledger in a very sneaky way that gets another kind of person to discover the great mystery. Need some more "why"s to be answered there. Also, your commit messages are wrong. I originally wanted prompts. i think it's actually better to just store all the prompts and tie them to a commit hash somehow. let's keep pushing

**Commit**: (pending)
**Files Modified**:

## Notes on Commit Process Going Forward

User wants actual prompts stored and tied to commit hashes, not just descriptions.

New system:
1. Log each prompt in this file with commit hash
2. Commit message can be shorter summary
3. Full prompt history preserved here
4. Easier to trace decision-making process
