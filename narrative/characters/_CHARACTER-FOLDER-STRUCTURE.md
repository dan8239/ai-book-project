# Character Folder Structure

## Organization

Each character gets a file with two sections:

### CANON
Things the user has decided and approved.

### IDEAS / POSSIBLE USES
Suggestions, speculative scenes, potential directions.
Clearly marked as NOT canon until user approves.

## Current Character Files

**Note**: Existing character files (COFFEE-GUY-CHARACTER.md, DEVSECOPS-GUY-ANALYSIS.md, CHARACTER-LIST.md) contain mix of canon and speculation. Will reorganize on request.
