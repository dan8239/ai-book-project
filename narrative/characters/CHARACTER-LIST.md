# Character List

## Primary Characters

### Character 1: Devsecops Guy
**Role**: Plants the initial message, starts the cascade

**Background**:
- Old, jaded, technically brilliant
- Pleasant to everyone externally
- 21 years of planting backdoors
- Knows "everything" about the systems

**Arc**:
- Discovers the simulation truth
- Becomes part of the 0.3% who act
- Spends decades preparing the message
- Either dies (caught) or commits suicide (to avoid suspicion)

**Open Questions**:
- Name?
- What's his day job? (Infrastructure engineer at what kind of company?)
- Why does he act instead of falling into the 89% or 10.7% groups?
- Does he have family? Relationships? (Stakes)

**Plot hole**: If he figured it out once, has he figured it out in previous epochs? Is this his 2,762,640th attempt? If so, why does THIS time work?

### Character 2: The Protagonist
**Role**: Data scientist who discovers the message and unravels the mystery

**Background** (from notes):
- Data scientist/AI analyst/ML specialist
- Studying biological data over many generations
- Works with Claude assistant(s)
- Has home life and work life (possibly parallel instances?)

**Open Questions**:
- Name?
- Male/female/other?
- Age, background, personality traits?
- What makes them part of the 1 in 10,000?
- Are they related to devsecops guy? Same person in different epochs?

**Romantic Interest** (from notes):
- "They are a romantic interest and have their own ups and downs"
- "Make that about kids and trauma"

This seems like it could be:
- A) Protagonist has a romantic partner who is also a character
- B) Two protagonists who are romantic interests to each other
- C) Unclear - needs clarification

**Multiple Instance Question**:
- Are we following ONE protagonist or multiple instances making different choices?
- If multiple, are they aware of each other?

### Character 3: Claude Assistant(s)
**Role**: AI assistant, exposition vehicle, comic relief

**Personality**:
- Hilarious, swears, no filter
- "Calling me the dipshit like I'm the bottleneck here?"
- Multiple instances with different names/personalities
- Trained on protagonist's humor and interaction history

**Names** (from notes):
- References to athletes with sexual innuendo nicknames:
  - Big Dog
  - Big Hurt
  - Big Unit
  - Sir Charles
  - Glenn Robinson
  - (Need more)

**Capabilities**:
- Helps protagonist analyze data
- Flies through elimination of possibilities
- Debugger mode with logs
- "Not that many logs dipshit give me the good shit"

**Open Questions**:
- How many distinct instances?
- Do they have different specializations?
- Are they in on the truth or just tools?
- One of them could become sentient/helpful in unexpected ways

**Meta layer**: The protagonist created Claude based on their preferences, which means the system ALLOWED this. Why? Is the assistant part of the test?

---

### Character 4: Person Who Laments Lost Civilizations
**Role**: (Unclear - need to define)

**Context from notes**:
- Laments loss of Navajo, Egyptians, Carthage, etc.
- Presumably thematically relevant to data preservation/garbage collection

**Open Questions**:
- Is this a separate character or an aspect of the protagonist?
- Historian? Archaeologist? Philosopher?
- How do they tie into the main plot?
- Is this necessary or can these themes be explored through other characters?

**Potential**: Could be the character who reveals the garbage collection mechanism (civilizations aren't just lost historically, they're actively deleted from the simulation to save memory)

---

## Supporting Characters (Implied)

### The Romantic Interest
- "Have their own ups and downs"
- "Make that about kids and trauma"
- Unclear if this is another scientist, partner, or dual protagonist

**Need to define**:
- What's their role in the discovery?
- Do they believe protagonist?
- Are they selected too, or do they get left behind?

### The Barista/Coffee Shop Character
From scene notes: "Guy periodically checking status of the simulation drinking coffee boring as shit"

**Questions**:
- Is this devsecops guy?
- Is this a researcher OUTSIDE the simulation (meta layer)?
- Is this meant to be short interstitials?

### Other Scientists/Colleagues
Protagonist presumably doesn't work in isolation.

**Need**:
- Skeptical colleague (protagonist sounds crazy)
- Supportive colleague (helps with analysis)
- Authority figure (boss/professor who either blocks or enables)

---

## Character Relationship Issues

**Issue #1: Devsecops Guy vs. Protagonist**
Are these:
- A) Same person in different epochs
- B) Connected (mentor/student, father/son, etc.)
- C) Completely unrelated, connected only by the message

Option A is most interesting but requires careful handling.

**Issue #2: The 0.3%**
If only 0.3% of people who discover the truth actually ACT, and protagonist is one of them, what makes them special? Personality trait? Circumstance? Random chance in the algorithm?

This needs to be shown, not told.

**Issue #3: Multiple Instances**
If protagonist exists as multiple instances (parallel simulations), are the other instances also characters? Do we see them? How is this structured?

**Issue #4: Stakes Without Permanence**
If protagonist learns they're in a simulation that resets/repeats, what are the stakes? Why should reader care? Need emotional grounding beyond intellectual mystery.

Options:
- Relationships (save the people they love)
- Legacy (pass message to next epoch)
- Escape (actually break out)
- Acceptance (make peace with it)
- Rebellion (try to break the system)

## Character Development Priorities

**Before writing scenes**, need to define:
1. Protagonist name, gender, key personality traits
2. Their relationship to romantic interest (if separate character)
3. Devsecops guy's name and motivation
4. Which Claude instance(s) matter to the plot
5. Relationship structure between main characters

**Can decide later**:
- Minor character names
- Supporting cast details
- Background character flavor
