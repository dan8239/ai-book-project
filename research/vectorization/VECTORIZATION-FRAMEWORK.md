# Vectorization Framework

## Key Insights

**Tweak CAUSES not EFFECTS** - Can only simulate things that could be replicated in reality. It must be actionable.

Can't simulate theoretical impossibilities. But can simulate ANYTHING humans have ever tried:
- Nefarious governments
- Every governmental strategy ever tried
- Rigging elections, misinformation, starting wars, corruption
- Mongol-style leadership, Roman, Capitalist, Spartan - everything

## What Gets Vectorized (Parameters Between Trials)

### Actionable Policy Levers
- Surveillance levels (0% → total panopticon)
- Wealth distribution (pure capitalism → full communism)
- Information control (full transparency → total censorship)
- Reproductive policy (free choice → enforced eugenics)
- Resource allocation (market-based → centrally planned)
- Leadership selection (democracy → hereditary → AI-selected)
- Individual rights (maximum freedom → collective obligation)
- Military strategy (pacifist → preemptive aggression)
- Education control (free thought → indoctrination)
- Technology development (unregulated → tightly controlled)

### Historical Systems as Data Points
Every system tried becomes a vector to dial up/down:
- Mongol expansion speed + Roman administration
- Spartan militarism + Athenian innovation
- Soviet planning + Singapore efficiency
- Nordic trust + Chinese scale
- etc.

## Optimization Goal (Corrected)

**NOT:** "How long can you survive?"

**IS:** "What minimizes long-term extinction probability?"

### How Trials Work
Run until:
- Extinction (record failure mode and conditions)
- OR stability threshold reached (low ongoing extinction risk)

Survival time is a PROXY for extinction risk, not the goal itself.

### Evaluation Metrics (Fixed)
- **Primary:** Probability of future extinction given current trajectory
- **Secondary:** Quality of life, sustainability, adaptability
- **Failure modes:** Nuclear war, climate collapse, AI misalignment, resource depletion, pandemic, social collapse

## Making Protagonist's World Feel Normal

Protagonist lives in an extreme but successful configuration. To them it's normal.

Examples (we'll pick ONE later):
- Mandatory genetic screening and partner assignment (feels normal to them)
- Complete financial transparency (no concept of financial privacy)
- Algorithmic resource allocation (never known market pricing)
- Rotating leadership lottery (democracy but different)
- Required public service years in specific roles
- Reproductive licenses based on societal need
- etc.

To protagonist: just how life works
To readers: dystopian/alien
But it WORKS for minimizing extinction

## Coffee Guy Misdirection

Early chapters: Coffee guy seems like IT bureaucrat or remote admin
- Blocking access
- Patching systems
- Internal politics

Only later: he's in a completely different world
Reader thinks he's annoying coworker → reveals he's outside the simulation entirely

## Memory/Compression (Revised Understanding)

NOT deleting loved ones mid-trial.

**Between trials:**
- Trial ends (extinction or success)
- Historical data archived
- Normies compressed to summary stats
- Important figures preserved in detail
- Next trial spins up

From inside a trial: you don't see this unless you discover you're IN a trial.
