# Geoengineering Options

Real-world data on planetary-scale interventions. NOT CANON.

## Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI)

### What It Is

Inject reflective particles (sulfur dioxide) into stratosphere to reflect sunlight back to space. Mimics volcanic eruptions like Pinatubo (1991).

### Feasibility

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Technology | Exists (aircraft, balloons, artillery) |
| Cost | $5-10 billion/year per degree C offset |
| Deployment time | Could start within 5 years |
| Effect duration | 1-2 years per injection |
| Reversibility | Yes - stop injecting, effects fade |

### Why It Can't Save Earth

**It only addresses temperature, not the actual problems:**

| Problem | SAI Helps? |
|---------|------------|
| Global warming | Yes - reflects sunlight |
| H₂S release from oceans | No - already triggered, temperature is one factor |
| Ozone destruction | No - sulfur aerosols actually damage ozone |
| Ocean acidification | No - CO₂ still accumulates |
| Ecosystem collapse | No - underlying causes unchanged |

**Critical flaw:** SAI requires continuous operation. Stop for 2 years → rapid warming resumes. This is a treadmill, not a solution.

**For the story:** SAI might buy a few decades but doesn't address the H₂S cascade or ozone collapse. Actually makes ozone worse.

## Space Sunshade

### What It Is

Giant mirrors or particle clouds at L1 Lagrange point to block portion of sunlight.

### Feasibility

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Technology | Does not exist at scale |
| Cost | Trillions of dollars |
| Deployment time | 30-50 years minimum |
| Mass required | Millions of tons to L1 |
| Vulnerability | Space debris, micrometeorites |

**IPCC conclusion:** "Not feasible at reasonable costs."

**For the story:** Non-starter. Takes longer than the crisis timeline and doesn't address chemistry.

## Ocean Iron Fertilization

### What It Is

Dump iron into oceans to trigger algae blooms that absorb CO₂.

### Why It Fails

- Algae die and decompose → release CO₂ back
- Can create dead zones (anoxia)
- Scale required is enormous
- Actually accelerates H₂S production in some scenarios

**For the story:** Some simulations probably tried this. Made things worse.

## Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS)

### What It Is

Machines that pull CO₂ from atmosphere and store it underground.

### The Math Problem

Current atmospheric CO₂: ~420 ppm (~3.2 trillion tons)
Annual emissions: ~40 billion tons
Largest CCS plant (Orca): 4,000 tons/year

**To just offset current emissions:** Need 10 million Orca plants
**To actually draw down CO₂:** Need 100+ million plants

Each plant costs ~$10-15 million. Total: $1-1.5 quadrillion.

**For the story:** Can't scale fast enough. Doesn't address H₂S.

## Genetic Engineering of Biosphere

### The Dream

Modify plants/algae to be more efficient at carbon capture. Modify animals to tolerate higher H₂S.

### Why It Fails

**Scale problem:**
- Earth has 8.7 million species
- All are interconnected in food webs
- Can't modify them all simultaneously
- Modified organisms compete with/displace natural ones

**Time problem:**
- Genetic modifications take generations to spread
- Ecosystem effects take decades to stabilize
- Crisis timeline: 50-100 years

**Complexity problem:**
- We don't fully understand how ecosystems work
- Unintended consequences are inevitable
- See: every invasive species ever

**For the story:** Simulations tried this. Some achieved partial success but ecosystem cascades still occurred. Best outcomes: 10-15% survival rates.

## Highland/Altitude Retreat

### The Theory

H₂S is heavier than air. Move everyone to mountains where atmosphere is cleaner.

### Why It Fails

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Capacity | Mountains can't support billions |
| Agriculture | High altitude = poor growing conditions |
| Infrastructure | No existing cities/systems at scale |
| UV exposure | Thinner atmosphere = more radiation (worse with ozone collapse) |
| Eventually equalizes | H₂S concentrations rise everywhere over decades |

**For the story:** Early response in many simulations. Buys 10-20 years, then same problems.

## The Pattern

Every Earth-based solution has the same problem:

1. **Fighting entropy** - Earth's systems are actively degrading
2. **Scale mismatch** - Solutions can't match 8 billion people
3. **Time mismatch** - Deployment takes longer than crisis allows
4. **Interconnection** - Can't fix one thing without breaking another

**Colonization avoids all of these:**
- Building fresh, not fighting decay
- Small payload (thousands, not billions)
- Time arbitrage (transit time doesn't matter if seed survives)
- Clean slate ecosystem design
