# Closed Ecosystem Failures

Real-world data on self-sustaining biospheres. NOT CANON.

## Biosphere 2 (1991-1994)

The most ambitious closed ecosystem experiment ever attempted.

### The Setup

- **Size:** 3.14 acres (137,000 sqft) enclosed
- **Cost:** $150-200 million (1991 dollars)
- **Crew:** 8 people
- **Goal:** 2-year sealed mission, no external inputs
- **Biomes:** Rainforest, ocean, desert, savannah, marsh, agricultural area

### What Went Wrong

**Oxygen Crisis:**
| Timeline | O₂ Level | Effect |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Start | 20.9% | Normal Earth atmosphere |
| 16 months | 14.5% | Equivalent to 13,400 ft altitude |
| Result | Emergency | O₂ injected from outside |

**Root Cause Chain:**
1. Rich organic soil supported thriving bacteria
2. Bacteria consumed O₂, produced CO₂
3. CO₂ should have fed plants → more O₂
4. Instead, CO₂ reacted with concrete walls (calcium hydroxide → calcium carbonate)
5. O₂ disappeared, wasn't recycled

**CO₂ Levels:**
- Outside: 350 ppm (1991)
- Inside: 2,000-4,000 ppm
- Plants couldn't keep up with bacterial respiration

**Species Collapse:**
- 25 vertebrate species started → 6 survived (76% extinction)
- Most insects went extinct
- Pollinators died → plants couldn't reproduce
- "Pest" species exploded: crazy ants, cockroaches, morning glory vines

**Other Problems:**
- Nitrous oxide reached brain-damage levels
- Crops failed repeatedly (not enough calories)
- Crew lost 10-18% body weight
- Social conflicts, crew split into factions

### Lessons Learned

1. **Ecosystems are incomprehensibly complex** - Can't design one from scratch
2. **Unexpected interactions dominate** - Concrete absorbing CO₂ wasn't predicted
3. **Small imbalances cascade** - Pollinators die → plants can't reproduce → O₂ drops
4. **Closed systems trend toward failure** - Entropy wins without external input
5. **Scale doesn't help** - Even 3+ acres wasn't enough buffering capacity

### Why This Matters for Earth Survival

If $200M and the world's best scientists couldn't maintain 8 people for 2 years, how do you maintain 8 billion for centuries?

**The math:**
- Biosphere 2: 17,125 sqft per person
- Earth bunkers: ~100-500 sqft per person
- Biosphere 2 failed with 100x more space per person

## Other Closed System Experiments

**BIOS-3 (Soviet Union, 1972-1984):**
- 3 people, 315 cubic meters
- Achieved 78% closure (still needed external food/supplies)
- Max duration: 180 days

**MELiSSA (ESA, ongoing):**
- Micro-Ecological Life Support System Alternative
- Still experimental, no full closure achieved
- Targets 6 people for Mars missions

## The Fundamental Problem

Earth's biosphere has:
- 4+ billion years of evolutionary optimization
- Trillions of species in balanced webs
- Massive buffers (oceans, atmosphere, soil)
- Self-repair mechanisms we don't understand

Artificial biospheres have:
- Decades of engineering
- Dozens to hundreds of species
- Tiny buffers
- No self-repair

**You cannot shortcut billions of years of ecosystem development.**
