# Fusion Power Timeline

Real-world data on fusion energy development. NOT CANON.

## Why Fusion Matters

Fusion could theoretically provide unlimited clean energy:
- Fuel (hydrogen isotopes) is abundant
- No carbon emissions
- No long-lived radioactive waste
- Energy density millions of times greater than chemical fuels

**If we had fusion, we could:**
- Desalinate unlimited water
- Power indoor farming for billions
- Run atmospheric scrubbers globally
- Provide life support indefinitely

**So why can't fusion save Earth?**

## Current State (2025)

### ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor)

| Milestone | Original Target | Current Estimate | Delay |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|-------|
| Construction start | 2008 | 2013 | 5 years |
| First plasma | 2016 | 2034 | 18 years |
| Full operation | 2020 | 2039 | 19 years |
| Cost | $5 billion | $22+ billion | 4x+ |

**Key insight:** ITER is a research reactor. It will never produce commercial power. It's the step BEFORE we can design commercial plants.

### Timeline to Commercial Fusion

| Phase | Optimistic | Realistic | Pessimistic |
|-------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| ITER proves net energy | 2035 | 2039 | 2045+ |
| DEMO reactor design | 2040 | 2045 | 2055 |
| First commercial plant | 2045 | 2055 | 2070+ |
| Scaled deployment | 2060 | 2080 | Never |

**Private sector claims:**
- Helion: "Commercial fusion by 2028" (skepticism warranted)
- 70% of fusion companies say grid power by 2035
- Reality: "No one has produced fusion at grid level, commercial scale" - Senate testimony 2024

### Construction Time for Power Plants

Even with working fusion technology:

| Plant Type | Design | Licensing | Construction | Total |
|------------|--------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Fission (existing tech) | 2-3 years | 3-5 years | 5-10 years | 10-18 years |
| Fusion (new tech) | 5+ years | 5-10 years | 10+ years | 20-25 years |

**To power civilization, you need thousands of plants.**

## The Time Problem

### Scenario: Fusion Works Tomorrow

Even if we achieved commercial fusion TODAY:

**Year 0:** First commercial plant design complete
**Year 5:** First plant licensed and under construction
**Year 15:** First plant operational (1 GW)
**Year 25:** 10 plants operational (10 GW)
**Year 40:** 100 plants operational (100 GW)
**Year 60:** 1000 plants operational (1 TW)

**Global energy demand:** ~18 TW (and growing)

Even with unlimited fusion blueprints, scaling takes 50-100 years.

### The Cascade Problem

But we don't have 50-100 years because:
1. Clathrate cascade is already triggered
2. H₂S release accelerates each decade
3. Ozone collapse ~50 years out
4. Civilization breakdown disrupts construction

**You can't build fusion plants while society is collapsing.**

The construction requires:
- Rare materials with complex supply chains
- Thousands of specialized engineers
- Stable governments issuing permits
- Functioning financial systems
- Working transportation networks

All of which degrade as the crisis worsens.

## Geothermal - The Other "Unlimited" Energy

### Why Geothermal Can't Scale Either

Geothermal is proven technology but:

| Constraint | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| Location-dependent | Only 6% of Earth has good geothermal potential |
| Drilling depth | Deep drilling is expensive, slow, dangerous |
| Reservoir depletion | Hot rock cools over decades |
| Induced seismicity | Causes earthquakes at scale |
| Current capacity | ~15 GW globally (0.1% of demand) |

**Scaling geothermal 100x would take 50+ years** - same timeline problem as fusion.

## The Core Insight

**Energy transition takes decades even with perfect technology.**

The crisis timeline is:
- H₂S cascade: accelerating NOW
- Ozone collapse: ~50 years
- Human extinction: ~100-150 years

The energy timeline is:
- Fusion proven: ~15 years
- Fusion scaled: ~50-80 years
- Geothermal scaled: ~40-60 years

**The lines cross in the wrong direction.**

## Why This Doesn't Apply to Colony Ships

Colony ships don't need to power civilization. They need to:
1. Keep a small payload alive during transit (nuclear thermal, solar)
2. Bootstrap on arrival (local geothermal, solar on new world)

**Starting from scratch on a virgin planet ≠ retrofitting a collapsing civilization.**
