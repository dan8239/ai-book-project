# Bunkers & Underground Survival

Real-world data on survival bunkers. NOT CANON.

## Current Technology (2025)

### Capacity & Duration

| Type | Capacity | Duration | Cost |
|------|----------|----------|------|
| Personal bunker | 4-10 people | 30-90 days | $50K-$500K |
| Luxury bunker (DBX) | 10 people | 1 year | $10M+ |
| Swiss communal shelters | 8+ million total | 4+ months | Government funded |
| Vivos xPoint (SD) | 5,000 people | 1 year | $25K-$200K per unit |

### Life Support Systems

**Air:**
- NBC (nuclear, biological, chemical) filtration
- ULPA filters (better than HEPA)
- CO₂ scrubbers
- Problem: Filters degrade, need replacement every 6-12 months

**Water:**
- Storage tanks (500-5000 gallons typical)
- Filtration systems
- Problem: Eventually runs out without external source

**Food:**
- Freeze-dried stores (30 days - 2 years)
- Hydroponics (1,200 sqft produces ~20% of needs for 10 people)
- Problem: Hydroponics need constant power, maintenance, expertise

**Power:**
- Diesel generators (fuel stores last 3-12 months)
- Battery banks (12-72 hour backup)
- Some have solar/geothermal
- Problem: Fuel runs out, generators fail

### Failure Modes

1. **Mechanical failure** - HVAC, filtration, pumps
2. **Fuel exhaustion** - Generators need constant fuel
3. **Supply depletion** - Food, water, medical, filters
4. **Psychological breakdown** - Isolation, conflict, suicide
5. **External breach** - Structural damage, contamination
6. **Disease** - Closed populations are vulnerable

## Swiss Civil Defense System

Switzerland has the most extensive bunker network:
- Shelter capacity for 114% of population
- Mandatory shelter space in all buildings since 1963
- Supplies: 4+ months food and fuel per shelter
- Air filtration rated for nuclear/chemical/biological

**Limitations:**
- Designed for nuclear war (weeks to months), not centuries
- Depends on eventually going outside
- No plan for permanent underground civilization

## Historical Data

**London Underground WWII:**
- 177,000 people sheltered nightly at peak
- Sanitation, disease, flooding were constant problems
- Duration: Hours to days, not months

**Cheyenne Mountain (NORAD):**
- 1,000+ person capacity
- 30-day independent operation
- Blast doors, springs for shock absorption
- Still requires external resupply for long-term

## Why Bunkers Can't Save Humanity

1. **Capacity:** ~50 million bunker spaces exist globally. Population: 8+ billion.
2. **Duration:** Best case 1-2 years. H₂S cascade: centuries.
3. **Resupply:** All bunkers assume eventual return to surface.
4. **Closed system failure:** See [[closed-ecosystems|Biosphere 2]] - even best efforts fail.
5. **Selection problem:** Who gets in? Social collapse outside.
