## Key Takeaways for Story

1. **Closed systems fail** - Biosphere 2 couldn't maintain O₂ for 2 years with unlimited resources
2. **Scale doesn't scale** - Bunkers work for dozens, not billions
3. **Energy takes decades** - Even fusion tomorrow → 20+ years to deploy at scale
4. **Geoengineering buys time, doesn't solve** - SAI cools planet but doesn't fix H₂S/ozone
5. **Seeds survive, ecosystems don't** - Can preserve genetic info, not living systems
