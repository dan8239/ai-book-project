# Geothermal Energy Limits

Real-world data on supercritical geothermal energy. NOT CANON.

## Why Geothermal Matters

Supercritical geothermal is the closest thing to "unlimited clean energy" that exists:
- Heat from Earth's core is effectively inexhaustible (billions of years)
- No fuel required (unlike nuclear/fossil)
- No emissions
- 24/7 baseload power (unlike solar/wind)

**If we had planetary-scale geothermal, we could:**
- Desalinate unlimited water
- Power indoor farming for billions
- Run atmospheric scrubbers globally
- Provide life support indefinitely

**So why can't geothermal save Earth?**

## Current State (2025)

### Conventional Geothermal

| Factor | Current Status |
|--------|----------------|
| Global capacity | ~16 GW (0.3% of electricity) |
| Leading countries | USA, Indonesia, Philippines, Turkey |
| Typical depth | 1-3 km |
| Temperature | 150-200°C |
| Limitation | Location-dependent (volcanic zones) |

### Supercritical Geothermal (The Breakthrough)

"Supercritical" means water above 374°C and 220 bar - a state between liquid and gas that carries 5-10x more energy than conventional steam.

**Iceland Deep Drilling Project (IDDP):**
- 2009: Accidentally hit magma at 2.1 km
- 2017: IDDP-2 reached 4.5 km, 427°C
- Result: One well produced 35 MW (vs 5 MW typical)
- Proves supercritical extraction is possible

**The promise:** Drill deep enough anywhere on Earth and you hit supercritical temperatures. Not location-dependent like conventional geothermal.

## Why Supercritical Geothermal CAN'T Save a Collapsing Earth

### The Technology Exists - Deployment Doesn't

Unlike fusion (which requires scientific breakthroughs), supercritical geothermal works today. The problem is pure logistics.

### Infrastructure Requirements Per Plant

| Component | Requirements |
|-----------|--------------|
| Drilling rigs | Specialized high-temp/high-pressure equipment |
| Well depth | 5-15 km (deeper = hotter = more power) |
| Drilling time | 1-3 years per well |
| Turbines | Corrosion-resistant supercritical steam turbines |
| Materials | Exotic alloys (nickel superalloys, ceramics) |
| Transmission | New grid infrastructure to transport power |
| Workforce | Highly specialized engineers, geologists |

### The Math Problem

**To power global civilization:**
- Current demand: ~18 TW
- Average supercritical plant: ~100-500 MW
- Plants needed: 36,000-180,000 plants

**Build rate:**
- Current geothermal construction: ~500 MW/year globally
- At current rate: 36,000-360,000 years to deploy
- At 10x current rate: 3,600-36,000 years
- At 100x current rate: 360-3,600 years

**Even with 1000x acceleration (impossible):** 36-360 years

### The Construction Paradox

Building at scale requires:
- Functioning steel mills (need workers, supply chains)
- Rare earth mining (need access to deposits, processing)
- Manufacturing facilities (need power, workers, logistics)
- Skilled labor (need training, time, stability)
- Transportation networks (need maintained roads, ports)

**As crisis worsens:**
- Workers die in euxinic events
- Supply chains break down
- Mining becomes impossible (safety, logistics)
- Manufacturing halts
- Construction stops

**You can't build your way out while civilization collapses.**

### Self-Replicating Robots (The Theoretical Solution)

In theory, von Neumann machines could bootstrap infrastructure exponentially:
1. Build robots that build robots
2. Robots mine materials
3. Robots build geothermal plants
4. Repeat

**Why it fails:**

| Constraint | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| Feedstock | Robots need raw materials - still need mining |
| Rare earths | Essential for electronics, motors - limited deposits |
| Energy for replication | Need existing power to build first generation |
| Time to scale | Exponential growth still takes 30-50 years |
| Maintenance | Robots break, need repair (more robots?) |
| Coordination | Need AI to manage; AI needs power/infrastructure |

**The bootstrapping problem:** You need infrastructure to build the infrastructure.

## Timeline Comparison

### Best Case Scenario (Everything Goes Right)

| Year | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 0 | Crash program starts |
| 5 | First supercritical plants operational |
| 10 | Self-replicating robot prototype |
| 15 | Robot production scaling |
| 25 | 5% of global energy from new geothermal |
| 40 | 25% of global energy |
| 60 | 75% of global energy (if civilization holds) |

### Crisis Timeline (What's Actually Happening)

| Year | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 0 | Program starts, H₂S events increasing |
| 10 | Coastal infrastructure failing |
| 20 | Supply chains breaking down |
| 30 | Worker deaths accelerating |
| 40 | Manufacturing collapse |
| 50 | Program abandoned |

**The lines cross in the wrong direction.**

## Why This Doesn't Apply to Colony Ships

Colony ships don't need to power a civilization. They need to:
1. Keep a small payload alive during transit (nuclear thermal, solar)
2. Bootstrap on arrival (local geothermal on virgin world)

**Key differences:**

| Factor | Earth | Colony |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Population to support | Billions | Thousands |
| Infrastructure | Retrofit collapsing system | Build from scratch |
| Supply chains | Breaking down | Don't exist yet (fresh start) |
| Timeline pressure | Crisis NOW | Transit can take centuries |
| Competition | Fighting entropy | Building order |

**Starting fresh on a virgin planet ≠ retrofitting a collapsing civilization.**
