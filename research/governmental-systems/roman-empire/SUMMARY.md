# Roman Empire

## What It Optimizes For
Long-term stability, administrative efficiency, territorial expansion, integration of diverse populations

## When/Where
27 BCE - 476 CE (Western), 1453 CE (Eastern Byzantine), Mediterranean + Europe + Middle East

## Key Policies / Differentiating Factors
- **Professional bureaucracy:** Separated administration from military, career civil servants
- **Codified law:** Twelve Tables â†’ Justinian Code, consistent legal framework
- **Tiered citizenship:** Roman citizen vs Latin rights vs peregrini, citizenship as incentive
- **Infrastructure investment:** Roads, aqueducts, public works (ROI over decades/centuries)
- **Religious tolerance:** Absorb local gods, only require emperor worship
- **Provincial governance:** Local autonomy with Roman oversight, tax farming
- **Standing professional army:** Not citizen militia, career soldiers

## Known Consistent Effects
- Lasted 500+ years (Western), 1000+ (Eastern)
- Integrated vastly different cultures
- Legal framework influenced all European law
- Infrastructure lasted centuries after collapse
- Bureaucratic bloat and corruption over time
- Eventually: too big to defend, barbarian pressure, internal decay

## Pros
- Extreme longevity
- Effective at scale
- Meritocratic advancement possible
- Innovation in engineering, law, administration
- Cultural exchange and spread of technology

## Cons
- Slavery required
- Corruption increased over time
- Wealth inequality grew
- Declined ability to adapt/reform
- Overextended resources
- Civil wars for succession

## Relevant for Vectorization
- **Bureaucratic depth:** How many administrative layers?
- **Citizenship tiers:** Gradated rights vs equality
- **Infrastructure investment horizon:** Short-term vs multi-generational
- **Central vs local control:** Balance of autonomy
- **Professional vs citizen armies:** Standing military cost
- **Legal codification:** Rule of law vs discretion

## Related Systems
- British Empire (similar administrative approach)
- Chinese dynastic bureaucracy (exam system, civil service)
- Modern EU (tiered integration)

## For Protagonist's World
Could dial up: long-term infrastructure planning, citizenship tiers for motivation, professional specialization
Could dial down: slavery (automation?), military expansion focus
