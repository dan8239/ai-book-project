# Governmental Systems Research Index

High-level overview of systems to research for vectorization and world-building.

## Ancient Systems

### Roman Empire
- **Optimizes for:** Stability, expansion, administrative efficiency, long-term governance
- **When:** 27 BCE - 476 CE (Western), 1453 CE (Eastern)
- **Key policy:** Professional bureaucracy, codified law, citizenship as tool, infrastructure investment
- **For vectorization:** Centralized administration levels, citizenship tiers, infrastructure investment ratios

### Mongol Empire
- **Optimizes for:** Rapid expansion, resource extraction, military dominance, meritocracy
- **When:** 1206-1368 CE
- **Key policy:** Merit-based leadership, religious tolerance, total war tactics, trade route control
- **For vectorization:** Meritocracy levels, expansion speed, resource extraction rates

### Spartan Society
- **Optimizes for:** Military excellence, social cohesion, stability through conformity
- **When:** ~900-192 BCE
- **Key policy:** Eugenics (agoge system), collective child-raising, warrior culture, helot labor underclass
- **For vectorization:** Selective breeding levels, communal vs individual child-rearing, military focus

### Athenian Democracy
- **Optimizes for:** Innovation, individual freedom, civic participation (for citizens)
- **When:** ~508-322 BCE
- **Key policy:** Direct democracy (for citizens), ostracism, lottery selection for offices
- **For vectorization:** Democratic participation levels, citizen vs non-citizen ratios

## Modern Experiments (20th Century)

### Soviet Union
- **Optimizes for:** Equality, industrial output, centralized control, ideological conformity
- **When:** 1922-1991
- **Key policy:** Central planning, collective ownership, single-party control, propaganda
- **For vectorization:** Central planning depth, wealth distribution extremes, information control

### Singapore
- **Optimizes for:** Economic prosperity, social stability, efficiency, meritocracy
- **When:** 1965-present
- **Key policy:** Benevolent authoritarianism, meritocratic bureaucracy, strict law enforcement, strategic planning
- **For vectorization:** Authoritarian efficiency vs democratic freedom trade-off

### Nordic Model (Sweden/Norway/Denmark)
- **Optimizes for:** Quality of life, equality, social trust, long-term sustainability
- **When:** Post-WWII to present
- **Key policy:** High taxation, comprehensive welfare, strong unions, mixed economy
- **For vectorization:** Tax levels, welfare comprehensiveness, trust-based systems

### Modern China
- **Optimizes for:** Economic growth, stability, technological advancement, party control
- **When:** 1949-present (especially post-Deng reforms)
- **Key policy:** Market socialism, tech-enabled surveillance, meritocratic-autocratic hybrid, long-term planning
- **For vectorization:** Surveillance levels, market vs planning balance, tech control

## Smaller-Scale / Alternative Models

### North Korea
- **Optimizes for:** Regime survival, ideological purity, isolation
- **When:** 1948-present
- **Key policy:** Total information control, dynastic succession, military-first, autarky
- **For vectorization:** Information control extremes, isolation levels

### Israeli Kibbutz Movement
- **Optimizes for:** Collective welfare, equality, agricultural productivity
- **When:** Early 1900s-present (evolved over time)
- **Key policy:** Voluntary collectivism, shared property, communal child-rearing (early), direct democracy
- **For vectorization:** Collectivism levels in voluntary systems

### Corporate Governance Models (hypothetical nation-state)
- **Optimizes for:** Efficiency, profit, competitiveness
- **Not yet implemented at nation scale**
- **Key policy idea:** Citizens as shareholders, meritocratic advancement, market-based everything
- **For vectorization:** Corporate structure applied to governance

## Systems Needing More Detail

Each folder should eventually contain:
- Full analysis using _TEMPLATE.md
- Historical sources
- Empirical data on outcomes
- Vectorization parameters we can extract
- Pros/cons for different optimization goals

## Priority for Initial Research

1. **Roman Empire** - administrative efficiency, scale
2. **Spartan** - extreme social engineering
3. **Singapore** - modern authoritarian success
4. **Soviet** - central planning extreme
5. **Nordic** - high-trust welfare state
6. **China** - tech-enabled control + markets
