# Soviet Union

## What It Optimizes For
Equality, industrial output, central control, ideological conformity, workers' welfare (in theory)

## When/Where
1922-1991, Russia + Eastern Europe + Central Asia

## Key Policies / Differentiating Factors
- **Central planning:** Gosplan sets all production targets, prices, distribution (no market)
- **Collective ownership:** No private property, state owns means of production
- **Single-party control:** Communist Party monopoly, no opposition
- **Propaganda apparatus:** Control of all media, education, culture
- **Internal passports:** Restricted movement, assigned housing/jobs
- **Full employment guarantee:** Everyone has job (even if unproductive)
- **Free education/healthcare:** Universal provision
- **Surveillance state:** KGB, informants, punishment for dissent

## Known Consistent Effects
- Rapid industrialization (1930s-1950s)
- WWII victory, superpower status
- Space program success (Sputnik, Gagarin)
- Eventually: stagnation, shortages, inefficiency
- Innovation lag (except military/space)
- Corruption, black markets emerged
- Environmental disaster (Aral Sea, Chernobyl)
- Collapsed 1991 (economic failure)

## Pros
- Eliminated extreme poverty (for a time)
- Universal education, healthcare
- Full employment
- Rapid industrialization possible
- Low inequality (officially)
- Housing guaranteed

## Cons
- Massive inefficiency (no price signals)
- Chronic shortages of consumer goods
- Innovation killed (no incentives)
- Totalitarian repression (Gulag, purges)
- Environmental devastation
- Corruption endemic
- Couldn't compete economically long-term
- Ultimately failed/collapsed

## Relevant for Vectorization
- **Central planning depth:** 0% (free market) to 100% (Gosplan)
- **Wealth equality enforcement:** Redistribution extremes
- **Movement restriction:** Internal migration control
- **Employment guarantee:** Right to work vs labor flexibility
- **Information control:** Propaganda/censorship levels
- **Ideological conformity requirement:** Thought policing degree

## Related Systems
- Maoist China (similar but more extreme during Cultural Revolution)
- North Korea (even more extreme version, still existing)
- Cuba (similar but smaller scale)

## For Protagonist's World
Could dial up: Central planning, equality enforcement, information control
Could dial down: Inefficiency (if AI does planning?), repression
Interesting question: **Could AI-driven central planning work where human planning failed?**
