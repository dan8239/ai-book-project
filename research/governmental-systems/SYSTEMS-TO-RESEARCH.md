# Governmental and Cultural Systems to Research

Historical and theoretical systems to understand for world-building and Act 3 exploration.

## Historical Governments and Cultures

### Ancient Civilizations
- Roman Empire (republic â†’ empire transition, governance at scale)
- Mongol Empire (leadership style, rapid expansion, resource management)
- Spartan society (extreme militarism, selective breeding, collective obligation)
- Athens (early democracy, direct vs representative)
- Egyptian dynasties (theocracy, centralized resource control)
- Persian Empire (tolerance policies, administrative systems)
- Chinese dynasties (Confucian bureaucracy, mandate of heaven, cyclical collapse)

### Different Organizing Principles
- Theocracies (religious law as governance)
- Military dictatorships (strength-based leadership)
- Merchant republics (Venice, Hanseatic League - trade-based power)
- Tribal confederations (Indigenous American governance models)
- City-states (Singapore, historical Italian cities - small-scale optimization)

## Modern and Recent Systems

### 20th Century Experiments
- Soviet communism (centralized planning, collective ownership)
- Chinese variants (market socialism, social credit, tech-enabled control)
- Nordic models (high tax, high service, trust-based)
- Singapore (benevolent authoritarianism, meritocracy, prosperity)
- North Korea (total information control, isolation, survival mode)
- Cuba (isolation, rationing, collective survival)

### Corporate and Alternative Models
- Mondragon (worker cooperatives at scale)
- Kibbutz movements (voluntary collectivism)
- Seasteading proposals (voluntary micro-nations)
- Corporate governance models applied to nations

## Extreme Policy Configurations (For Vectorization)

### Things to Research Deeply
- What happens when you dial surveillance to 100%? To 0%?
- Maximum wealth redistribution vs zero redistribution
- Total information transparency vs complete opacity
- Reproduction controlled vs completely free
- Democratic extremes: direct democracy for everything vs zero input
- Resource allocation: pure market vs total central planning
- Individual rights: maximum freedom vs total collective obligation

### Books/Thought Experiments About Policy Extremes
- 1984 (Orwell) - total surveillance and thought control
- Brave New World (Huxley) - engineered happiness and stability
- The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas (Le Guin) - utilitarian extremes
- Gattaca - genetic determinism
- Player Piano (Vonnegut) - automation and meaning
- Ecotopia - environmental extremism
- The Dispossessed (Le Guin) - anarchist society
- Red Mars trilogy (Robinson) - competing governance models on Mars

### Academic/Philosophical Work
- Political philosophy on trade-offs (freedom vs security, equality vs excellence)
- Game theory and cooperation (Prisoner's Dilemma, tragedy of commons)
- Constitutional design and mechanism design
- Behavioral economics and policy nudges
- Historical analysis of civilization collapse

## Questions to Answer

1. What configurations have been tried and failed? Why?
2. What worked in small scale but failed at large scale? (or vice versa)
3. What are the actual trade-offs? (not ideological claims, but real outcomes)
4. What has never been tried because it's too extreme/controversial?
5. What becomes possible with perfect information/simulation?
6. What moral lines do you have to cross to succeed?

## For Act 3

Keep the good research to mention other successful trial worlds:
- "Trial 342,891 succeeded via X but sacrificed Y"
- "Trial 1,293,445 achieved Z through complete A"
- Reader gets to see the menu of options and their costs
- Not prescriptive - just showing what the trade-offs actually are
