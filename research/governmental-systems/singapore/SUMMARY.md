# Singapore

## What It Optimizes For
Economic prosperity, social stability, efficiency, meritocracy, long-term planning

## When/Where
1965-present, City-state (Southeast Asia)

## Key Policies / Differentiating Factors
- **Benevolent authoritarianism:** One-party dominant (PAP), limited dissent, pragmatic not ideological
- **Meritocratic bureaucracy:** Highest-paid civil servants in world, attract best talent
- **Strict law enforcement:** Death penalty for drugs, caning, heavy fines, clean/orderly society
- **Strategic economic planning:** Government-directed capitalism, targeted industries
- **Public housing dominance:** 80% live in gov housing (HDB), creates dependency/stability
- **Multiracial quotas:** Enforced diversity in housing to prevent ethnic enclaves
- **Mandatory savings:** CPF (Central Provident Fund) - forced retirement/healthcare savings
- **Education meritocracy:** Streaming from young age, competition for spots

## Known Consistent Effects
- Extreme economic success (GDP per capita among highest in world)
- Very low crime, corruption
- High quality of life (infrastructure, healthcare, education)
- Political stability (same party since independence)
- Self-censorship, limited political freedom
- High stress, competitive culture
- Dependent on government systems
- Works at small scale (5.7M people)

## Pros
- Prosperity without democracy (counterexample to Western model)
- Long-term planning actually executed
- Clean, efficient, functional
- Meritocracy allows mobility
- Racial harmony enforced successfully

## Cons
- Authoritarian - limited speech, press, assembly
- High conformity pressure
- "Nanny state" - controls many life aspects
- Caning, death penalty
- Stress culture, mental health issues
- Unclear if scales beyond city-state
- Succession risk (Lee Kuan Yew cult of personality)

## Relevant for Vectorization
- **Authoritarian efficiency:** How much control for how much prosperity?
- **Meritocracy enforcement:** Competitive sorting from what age?
- **Law strictness:** Severity of punishment for order
- **Government housing dependence:** Control via essential services
- **Long-term planning power:** Can government override short-term pain?
- **Forced savings rates:** Individual vs collective provision

## Related Systems
- Plato's philosopher-kings (enlightened autocracy)
- Chinese governance model (pragmatic authoritarianism)
- UAE (Gulf states - prosperity + control)

## For Protagonist's World
Could dial up: meritocratic sorting, long-term planning, efficiency focus, government control of housing/services
Could dial down: political freedom, individual autonomy, tolerance for disorder
Interesting: seems to "work" but requires sacrificing democratic norms
