# Nordic Model (Sweden/Norway/Denmark)

## What It Optimizes For
Quality of life, equality, social trust, long-term sustainability, work-life balance

## When/Where
Post-WWII to present, Scandinavia (Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Iceland)

## Key Policies / Differentiating Factors
- **High taxation:** 40-60% total tax burden (progressive income + VAT)
- **Comprehensive welfare:** Universal healthcare, education, childcare, elderly care, unemployment
- **Strong unions:** High unionization (~70%), collective bargaining power
- **Mixed economy:** Free market + strong safety net, not socialist
- **Generous parental leave:** 1+ years paid, shared between parents
- **Free education:** Through university, living stipends
- **Active labor market:** Training, job placement help (not just unemployment checks)
- **High social trust:** Low corruption, people trust government/each other

## Known Consistent Effects
- Highest quality of life indexes
- Low poverty, low inequality (Gini coefficient)
- High happiness/satisfaction scores
- Strong economy despite high taxes
- High gender equality
- Low crime rates
- Sustainable (environmental and fiscal)
- Works for small, homogeneous populations (historically)

## Pros
- Very high quality of life
- Low inequality without sacrificing prosperity
- Work-life balance
- Trust-based society (low corruption)
- Innovation still happens (Spotify, Ericsson, IKEA, etc.)
- Environmental leadership
- Gender equality

## Cons
- Requires very high taxes (reduced take-home)
- Requires high social trust (hard to replicate elsewhere)
- Historically homogeneous (changing with immigration)
- Small population (unclear if scales to 300M+)
- Can discourage extreme ambition/entrepreneurship
- Dependent on strong economy (oil wealth for Norway)
- Cultural conformity pressure ("Jantelagen" - tall poppy syndrome)

## Relevant for Vectorization
- **Tax levels:** How high before diminishing returns?
- **Welfare comprehensiveness:** What's covered universally vs privately?
- **Trust requirement:** Can low-trust societies adopt this? Or must build trust first?
- **Union power:** Labor vs capital balance point
- **Work-life balance enforcement:** Mandated time off, work hour limits
- **Education investment:** Free through what level?

## Related Systems
- Social democracies generally (Germany, Netherlands)
- Post-war consensus (UK, pre-Thatcher)

## For Protagonist's World
Could dial up: Welfare comprehensiveness, work-life balance mandates, equality focus
Could dial down: Individual ambition, wealth accumulation
Requires: High social trust (hard to engineer?)
**Key question:** Can you build the trust required, or does it require specific cultural history?
