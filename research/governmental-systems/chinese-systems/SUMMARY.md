# Modern China (Post-Deng)

## What It Optimizes For
Economic growth, political stability, technological advancement, party control, long-term strategic power

## When/Where
1978-present (Deng reforms onward), China

## Key Policies / Differentiating Factors
- **"Socialism with Chinese Characteristics":** Market economy + Communist Party control
- **Tech-enabled surveillance:** Social credit, facial recognition, total digital tracking
- **Meritocratic-autocratic hybrid:** Competitive bureaucracy, no democracy
- **Long-term planning:** 5-year plans, 50-year strategies (Belt & Road)
- **State capitalism:** Strategic industries state-controlled, others market-driven
- **Great Firewall:** Information control, censorship, propaganda
- **One-child policy (now relaxed):** Demographic engineering
- **Uyghur camps / Tibet:** Ethnic control through technology + force
- **Economic zones:** Experimental areas (Shenzhen), test then scale

## Known Consistent Effects
- Fastest sustained economic growth in history (1980-2010)
- 800M lifted from poverty
- Technological leapfrogging (mobile payments, high-speed rail, AI)
- Innovation in surveillance/control technology
- Political stability (no regime change)
- Totalitarian control maintained despite prosperity
- Environmental disaster â†’ cleanup (smog reduced recently)
- Rising nationalism, "wolf warrior" diplomacy
- Unclear sustainability (debt, demographics, middle-income trap?)

## Pros
- Extreme economic success
- Can execute long-term plans (infrastructure, green energy)
- Lifted hundreds of millions from poverty
- Technological advancement
- Political stability
- Can pivot fast (COVID response)
- Coordination at massive scale

## Cons
- Totalitarian repression (Tiananmen, HK, Xinjiang)
- No political freedom
- Surveillance dystopia
- Ethnic persecution
- Environmental damage (though improving)
- Corruption (despite anti-corruption campaigns)
- Demographic crisis looming (aging, gender imbalance)
- Economic model sustainability questioned

## Relevant for Vectorization
- **Surveillance intensity:** Tech-enabled tracking levels
- **Market vs control:** Which sectors state-controlled vs market
- **Information control:** Firewall, censorship depth
- **Meritocracy within autocracy:** Competitive advancement without democracy
- **Long-term planning power:** Can override short-term pain for long-term goals
- **Ethnic/cultural homogeneity enforcement:** Assimilation pressure
- **Experimental zones:** Test policies at small scale before scaling

## Related Systems
- Singapore (similar pragmatic authoritarianism, smaller scale)
- South Korea (developmental state model, pre-democratization)
- Japan (MITI-guided capitalism, democratic version)

## For Protagonist's World
Could dial up: Tech surveillance, long-term planning, meritocratic bureaucracy, experimental policy zones
Could dial down: Ethnic persecution, information control
**Most interesting:** Prosperity + growth + stability WITHOUT democracy
**Key question:** Does surveillance + AI make benevolent dictatorship viable long-term?
