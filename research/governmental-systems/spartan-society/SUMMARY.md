# Spartan Society

## What It Optimizes For
Military excellence, social stability through conformity, warrior culture supremacy

## When/Where
~900-192 BCE, Ancient Greece (Laconia region)

## Key Policies / Differentiating Factors
- **Agoge system:** Mandatory state education/training from age 7, brutal conditioning
- **Eugenics:** Weak babies exposed (killed), selective breeding encouraged
- **Communal child-rearing:** Children raised by state, not families
- **Helot underclass:** Enslaved population (7:1 helots to Spartans) did all labor
- **Equal land distribution:** Among Spartan citizens (homoioi - "equals")
- **Banned commerce/luxury:** Citizens forbidden from trade, focus only on war
- **Dual kingship + council:** Unusual political structure, checks on power

## Known Consistent Effects
- Unmatched infantry (hoplites) for 200+ years
- Social cohesion among warrior class
- Cultural stagnation (no arts, philosophy, innovation)
- Constant fear of helot rebellion (crypto - secret police to terrorize helots)
- Declining population (warriors kept dying, birth restrictions)
- Eventually collapsed due to inability to adapt

## Pros
- Military effectiveness
- Internal stability (for citizens)
- Equality among citizen class
- Strong collective identity
- Low crime (among citizens)

## Cons
- Required massive slave class
- Zero innovation
- Brutal treatment of children
- Suppression of individuality
- Rigid, couldn't adapt to changes
- Ultimately failed (depopulation, inability to recover from defeats)

## Relevant for Vectorization
- **Communal child-rearing level:** 0% (family) to 100% (state)
- **Selective breeding enforcement:** 0% (free choice) to 100% (mandatory eugenics)
- **Military focus:** % of population/resources devoted to defense
- **Underclass ratio:** Economic productivity via slave/helot labor
- **Luxury/commerce restrictions:** Degree of sumptuary laws
- **Individual vs collective:** Rights suppression for group cohesion

## Related Systems
- Israeli kibbutz (voluntary communal child-rearing)
- North Korea (military-first policy - Songun)
- Plato's Republic (philosopher-kings, communal breeding - inspired by Sparta)

## For Protagonist's World
Could dial up: selective breeding, communal child-rearing, military focus
Could dial down: slave underclass (automation instead?), lack of innovation
