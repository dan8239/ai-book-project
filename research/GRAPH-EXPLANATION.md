# What You're Looking At: Graph Explanations for Non-Scientists

## The Basic Concept

Imagine you have a family tree. If you go back far enough, everyone shares a common ancestor. **How far back** you have to go to find that shared ancestor tells you something about the population.

**The Problem in Your Story:**
- The simulation was created from a **tiny sample** of DNA (23andMe data from ~2025)
- They had to **fake** all the genetic history before that
- When the protagonist analyzes the DNA, he can **see the fake**

## Graph 1: The Main Discovery - Coalescence Time Distribution

### What This Graph Shows
**How long ago** pairs of people shared a common ancestor.

### What to Look For

**Normal population (TOP graph - blue):**
- Some pairs share ancestors recently (siblings, cousins)
- Some pairs share ancestors way back (distant relationships)
- The graph is **MESSY/NOISY** - natural randomness
- Follows a smooth declining curve (exponential)

**Bootstrapped population (MIDDLE graph - red):**
- Everyone shares ancestors at almost the **SAME TIME**
- Graph is too narrow, too compressed
- This is IMPOSSIBLE in a real population
- It reveals: everyone was created from same small group recently

**The Smoking Gun (BOTTOM graph - purple):**
- There's a **KINK** where the pattern suddenly changes
- Left side (green): Real simulation running = messy/natural
- Right side (orange): Fake back-calculated history = too smooth
- The red line is where the simulation started (consolidation date)
- **This discontinuity is impossible in real evolution**

### Why This Matters
In a real population that's been around for thousands of years, you should see ancestors spread across ALL time periods. Here, everyone traces back to the SAME moment (consolidation). That's only possible if they were all created from a subsample at that exact moment.

## Graph 2: Mismatch Distribution

### What This Graph Shows
How **genetically different** random pairs of people are from each other.

### What to Look For

**Normal population (LEFT - blue):**
- Wide spread of differences
- Some people very similar (close relatives)
- Some people very different (distant ancestry)
- Natural variation

**Bootstrapped (RIGHT - red):**
- Everyone is TOO SIMILAR to each other
- Too narrow, too uniform
- Missing the "distant relatives" tail
- This reveals: created from limited genetic diversity

### Why This Matters
Real populations have huge genetic diversity. If you sample 100 random people worldwide, some will be very similar, some very different. But if you bootstrap from a small sample, EVERYONE is too closely related. The graph is too narrow.

## Graph 3: Bayesian Skyline Plot

### What This Graph Shows
How big the population was at different times in history.

**Both axes are LOGARITHMIC** (each step is 10x the previous)

### What to Look For

**Blue line (real population):**
- Natural ups and downs
- Bottlenecks (population crashes)
- Expansions (population growth)

**Red line (bootstrapped simulation):**
- TOO FLAT before consolidation
- Suddenly matches reality AFTER consolidation
- The discontinuity at consolidation is visible

### Why This Matters
The effective population size implied by genetic diversity is way smaller than what's claimed. Before consolidation, the red line is too flat and too small - it reveals the population was artificially created with limited diversity.

## Graph 4: TMRCA Across Genome

### What This Graph Shows
As you move along a chromosome, different regions have different ancestry times (because of recombination/sexual reproduction mixing things up).

### What to Look For

**Normal (TOP - blue):**
- NOISY, lots of variation
- Some regions very old ancestry, some recent
- Natural randomness from recombination

**Bootstrapped (BOTTOM - red):**
- TOO SMOOTH
- Everything clusters around same time
- Artificial floor (red dashed line) - can't go older than consolidation
- Missing ancient coalescences

### Why This Matters
In real populations, recombination creates a mosaic - different parts of your genome trace back to different times. Here, EVERYTHING traces back to consolidation date. That's impossible unless the population was created then.

## Graph 5: The Smoking Gun - All Evidence Combined

This shows all 4 pieces of evidence together:

**Top Panel:** The KINK - pattern changes at consolidation
**Middle Left:** Effective population size too small (claimed 10 million, actually 50,000)
**Middle Right:** 100% of people trace to the subsample
**Bottom:** Everyone hits common ancestor at EXACT same date (impossible)

## The Simple Version

Imagine you claim your family has been in America for 10 generations (250 years). But when someone does a DNA test, they discover:

1. ALL your ancestors trace back to 1950 (only 75 years ago)
2. Everyone in your "family tree" is way too genetically similar
3. Before 1950, the family tree looks fake/calculated
4. After 1950, it looks natural

**Conclusion:** Your family was created/invented in 1950, not 250 years ago.

That's what the protagonist discovers about the entire human population - it was bootstrapped from a subsample at consolidation, not naturally evolved over thousands of years.

## What Each Graph's "Slope" or "Shape" Tells You

### Graph 1: Exponential decay rate
- **Steep drop** = small population (everyone related recently)
- **Gentle decline** = large population (takes longer to find common ancestors)
- **Kink** = population was artificially created at that point

### Graph 2: Width of distribution
- **Wide** = lots of genetic diversity
- **Narrow** = limited diversity (bootstrapped from small sample)

### Graph 3: Population size over time
- **Flat line** = constant population
- **Rising** = population growth
- **Discontinuity** = something artificial happened

### Graph 4: Variation along genome
- **Noisy** = natural recombination
- **Smooth** = artificially calculated/bootstrapped
