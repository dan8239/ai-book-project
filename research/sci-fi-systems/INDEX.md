# Sci-Fi Systems to Research

Fictional societies that explored optimization extremes.

## To Explore

### Utopian Visions
- Star Trek Federation (post-scarcity, meritocracy, exploration)
- Culture series (AI-guided anarchism, post-scarcity)
- Ecotopia (ecological sustainability priority)
- The Dispossessed (anarchist society)

### Dystopian Extremes
- 1984 (total surveillance, thought control)
- Brave New World (engineered happiness, caste system)
- Gattaca (genetic determinism)
- Handmaid's Tale (theocratic control, reproduction)
- Snowpiercer (rigid hierarchy, closed system)

### Thoughtful Alternatives
- Le Guin's Hainish Cycle (multiple experimental societies)
- Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy (competing governance models)
- The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas (utilitarian extreme)
- Player Piano (automation and meaning)
- Three-Body Problem (survival at any cost)

### Relevant Mechanics
- What did the author optimize for?
- What was sacrificed?
- What made it work (or fail)?
- What's the vectorization insight?

Each needs brief: premise, what it optimizes for, key trade-offs, what it teaches us.
