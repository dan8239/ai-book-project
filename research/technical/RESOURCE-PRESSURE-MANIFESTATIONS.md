# Resource Pressure Manifestations

How to show (not tell) that coffee guy's world is under severe resource pressure.

## Climate Details (Locked)
- City in Idaho/Canada region
- Climate like arid/dry Denver (should be much cooler/wetter given latitude)
- Major desertification has occurred

## Small Changes to Research/Develop

### Water Scarcity Indicators
**Things that might not exist anymore:**
- Lawns / ornamental landscaping
- Public fountains
- Car washing
- Swimming pools (private)
- Long showers

**Things that might be different:**
- Rationing (personal allowances?)
- Pricing (tiered, punitive for overuse?)
- Recycling systems (greywater for everything)
- Daily habits (wipe-down instead of shower? Navy showers only?)
- Architecture (water collection built into buildings?)

**Subtle showing:**
- Coffee guy's routine around water use
- Pricing visible on bills/screens
- Absent things (dusty cars, brown yards, dry parks)
- Technology (ultra-efficient everything)

### Energy Scarcity Indicators
**Things that might not exist:**
- Air conditioning everywhere
- 24/7 lighting
- Personal vehicles (or very limited)
- Data centers in every city
- Cheap computation

**Things that might be different:**
- Rolling blackouts / brownouts
- Priority systems (who gets power when)
- Shared transportation
- Working hours tied to power availability
- Heat as luxury

**Subtle showing:**
- Coffee guy's commute/transportation
- Office hours (work during peak solar?)
- Darkness in unused areas
- Calculation about whether to use something

### Food Scarcity Indicators
**Things that might not exist:**
- Meat (or very rare/expensive)
- Variety (seasonal only?)
- Waste (no throwing food away)
- Restaurants everywhere
- Imported foods

**Things that might be different:**
- Rationing (calories per person?)
- Synthetic/lab foods normal
- Vertical farms visible
- Meal culture (eating at home only? communal kitchens?)
- Status symbols (fresh fruit? real meat?)

**Subtle showing:**
- What coffee guy eats/drinks
- Price tags visible
- What's offered vs what's chosen
- Absence of variety

## Research Needed

### Historical Examples
- What did rationing look like in WWII? (UK, US, Germany)
- Water rationing in drought areas (California, Australia, Cape Town)
- Energy rationing (blackouts, USSR, developing nations)
- Food scarcity adaptations (Cuba during Special Period)

### Realistic Projections
- What happens when Denver gets 30% less water?
- What's the minimum viable water per person?
- How do power grids handle 50% reduction?
- What's the psychological adaptation to scarcity?

### Show Don't Tell Techniques
- Normal to character, striking to reader
- Absence of things (don't mention, just not there)
- Changed behavior patterns
- Visible infrastructure
- Casual mentions (price tags, allowances, restrictions accepted as normal)

## Goal
Coffee guy's world feels subtly wrong/different from very first chapter, before reader knows he's in real world vs simulation. Little details accumulate.
