# Research Needed

Technical details to investigate for realism and accuracy.

## Quantum Computing & Simulation

### Memory and Quantum Tech
- How quantum memory works (realistic implementation)
- What advances would enable full human consciousness simulation?
- Energy efficiency gains from quantum vs classical computing
- Advantages of quantum for simulation specifically
- What are the realistic timescales? (protagonist's world in milliseconds, coffee guy's world in one day)

### Simulation Realism
- How much data to simulate a human life?
- Memory requirements per simulated human
- How to optimize/compress less important simulations (normies vs celebrities)
- What gets lost in compression?

## Resource Crisis (Real World Setting)

### Environmental
- Realistic desertification patterns by 2040s-2050s
- Food/water scarcity scenarios
- Energy crisis implications

### Social Impact
- How does resource scarcity affect society structure?
- What changes in daily life?
- Technology development under resource constraints

## ML/AI Concepts to Weave In

### Evolutionary Algorithm Basics
- How genetic algorithms actually work (step by step)
- Trials vs generations vs epochs - technical definitions
- Population, selection, crossover, mutation - what do these mean?
- How do you adjust parameters between generations?
- Fitness evaluation vs loss function - same thing or different?
- What makes a "good" trial in evolutionary optimization?

### Optimization Algorithms
- NSGA-II details (Pareto front, crowding distance, selection)
- Evolutionary algorithms at scale
- Loss function design for multi-objective optimization
- When/why genetic algorithms vs other approaches?

### Real Papers/Concepts
- Recent ML papers relevant to evolutionary optimization
- Quantum computing + ML intersection
- Multi-objective optimization in policy/government
- Simulation-based policy testing (if it exists)

## Blockchain/Data Persistence

### Message Mechanism
- How blockchain could persist across simulation resets
- Backdoor implementation at firmware/template level
- What signs would be left behind when altering immutable ledgers?
- Realistic exploit vectors
