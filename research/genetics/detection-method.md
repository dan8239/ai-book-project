# How Protagonist Detects Bootstrapped Population

## The Flaw
Bootstrapping technique is excellent - proper recombination, realistic haplotypes, correct mutation rates. But fundamental limit: **Can't create 100,000 years of genetic diversity from 100 years of real mutation + reshuffling finite sample.**

## Three-Step Detection

**Step 1: Rare variant age distribution**
- Expected: Smooth exponential across all ages
- Actual: Two clusters (90% at consolidation, 10% recent)
- Missing: All variants from deep time (1,000-100,000 years)

**Step 2: Total rare variant count**
- Expected: ~10^8 variants (8B people, 100K year history)
- Actual: ~10^6.1 variants (missing 99%)

**Step 3: Archaeological CPU comparison**
- 90% of current rare variants trace directly to seed data
- Impossible - they should either predate seed OR appear post-seed
- Conclusion: Population created FROM seed data

## The Graphs
1. **Bayesian Skyline Plot** - Population "appears" at consolidation (discontinuity)
2. **Site Frequency Spectrum** - Missing ultra-rare variants
3. **Variant Age Distribution** - Two clusters, missing middle

## Eliminating False Explanations
- Population bottleneck? Doesn't create age clustering
- Selection sweep? Wrong signature
- Data quality issues? Doesn't explain perfect clustering at consolidation
- Sampling bias? Can't affect age distribution pattern

## The Process
1. Initial: "Diversity seems low"
2. Tests bottleneck, selection hypotheses - don't match
3. Checks data quality - data is fine
4. Realizes: "Why do 90% trace to exact consolidation date?"
5. Gets archaeological CPU, confirms they trace to seed
6. Conclusion: Bootstrapped
