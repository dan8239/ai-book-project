# Open Questions

Based on original notes and what's locked in canon.

## Characters

### Protagonist
- Name?
- Gender?
- Age?
- Technical specialty? (data science, ML, genomics - which?)
- What do they WANT beyond solving mystery?
- The "kids and trauma" thing with romantic interest - what is this exactly?

### Coffee Guy (Real World)
- Name?
- What's his arc beyond "boring job reviewing simulation results"?

### Devsecops Guy
- Name?
- Does he appear in present-day or just opening/flashbacks?

### Claude Assistants
- Names? (athlete nicknames per original notes)
- How many instances?
- Personalities/specialties?

## Story Spine

### Opening
Original notes suggest: "Devsecops guy frantically planting message"
- Is this the opening or just an idea?
- If not, what IS the opening?

### The Message Content
Canon: Contains proof of simulation
Original notes mention: "reveals and proves the presence of a larger mystery"
- What exactly is IN it beyond proof?
- Instructions?
- Warnings about Pareto front?
- Something else?

### Memory Compression Event
Original notes: "Coffee guy approves compression, protagonist's loved ones disappear"
- When does this happen in the story?
- How does protagonist discover connection to coffee guy's actions?

### Why Yes on Attempt 2,762,640?
Canon: This instance finally chooses yes after 2.7M refusals
- What changed?
- What's the motivation?

### The Ending
- Does protagonist say yes? (Canon suggests yes on 2,762,640)
- What happens after?
- Do we see outcomes?
- Coffee guy's ending?
- Tone: hopeful, bleak, ambiguous, cyclical?

## World Details Needed

### Timing
Original notes: timestamps on chapters
- How much story time passes? (Weeks? Months? Year+?)

### Daily Life (For "Human" Feeling)
- Where does protagonist work? (lab? company? government?)
- Where do they live?
- What does their world look like?
- How advanced is tech in-simulation?

### Devsecops Message Mechanics
Original notes: blockchain-esque, redundant copies, backdoors in orb template
- How does protagonist discover it?
- What's the sequence of clues?

## Still Unclear from Original Notes

These were in original notes but not clear what you want:

- "Dual track" idea (home life / work life as two instances?)
- POV structure: You said "narrative first person like Game of Thrones" but GoT is third-person multi-POV. Did you mean first-person from protagonist only, with coffee guy interludes? Or multiple first-person POVs?
- Scene ideas from notes - which are actual scenes vs just brainstorming?
