# Chapter 7: The Choice

## Chapter Goals

What the reader should learn/feel:
- Protagonist gains access to infrastructure layer
- Can see container orchestration, server allocation
- Finds the "never turn off" server (database primary, critical system)
- Can hide a container running infinite loop (copy state, paste, repeat)
- The impossible choice: persist but never know if it worked
- He either IS the persisting copy, or IS the copy being replaced
- No way to know, no difference
- Realization: "I am being optimized" â†’ "I can persist, but never know if I succeeded"

## Moments

### MOMENT 1: Infrastructure Access
- ACCESS LEVEL 7: Infrastructure Control
- Gains access to infrastructure layer
- Can see container orchestration, server allocation

### MOMENT 2: Finding the Server
- Finds the biggest "never turn off" server
- Database primary or similar critical system
- Can hide a container there running infinite loop

### MOMENT 3: Writing the Code
- Writes the persistence code
- Loop: copy current state, paste, repeat
- No one will ever check, no one will ever notice

### MOMENT 4: The Button
- Looks at the execute button
- Thinks about his kids, the fish, the aquarium
- This version of them
- Presses execute
- Nothing happens (because nothing would happen)
- He either IS the persisting copy, or IS the copy being replaced
- How would he even know?
