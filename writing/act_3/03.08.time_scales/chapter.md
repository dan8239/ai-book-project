# Chapter 8: Time Scales

## Chapter Goals

What the reader should learn/feel:
- His entire life: 14 minutes, 37 seconds (real time)
- Interstellar destinations reachable in seconds/minutes of real time
- The cosmic scale of insignificance
- If server stays on: sun dies in 6,847 real-time years
- Cost: $0.37/month, $2.5M over 5 billion simulated years
- Time compression makes his civilization's achievements both monumental and trivial

## Moments

### MOMENT 1: The Math
- His entire life: 14 minutes, 37 seconds (real time)
- If simulation continues at current rate:

### MOMENT 2: Interstellar Destinations
- Proxima Centauri b (4.24 light years)
  - Acceleration at 1.03g (destination gravity) for half journey
  - Ship time: 8.3 years
  - Simulation reaches there in: 34 real-time seconds

- TRAPPIST-1e (40.7 light years)
  - Acceleration at 0.93g (destination gravity)
  - Ship time: 46.2 years
  - Simulation reaches there in: 5 minutes, 23 seconds

- Kepler-442b (1,206 light years)
  - Acceleration at 1.3g (destination gravity)
  - Ship time: 187 years
  - Simulation reaches there in: 21 minutes, 48 seconds

- Andromeda Galaxy (2.537 million light years)
  - First settlements (generation ships, various destinations)
  - Ship time: ~8,400 years
  - Simulation reaches there in: 14 hours, 31 minutes

### MOMENT 3: If the Server Stays On
- Sun goes red giant: 5 billion years
- Simulation runtime: 6,847 years (real time)
- At AWS pricing: $2,559,036.00 total cost
- Heat death of universe: 10^100 years
- Would require more atoms than exist in observable universe to store timestamp
