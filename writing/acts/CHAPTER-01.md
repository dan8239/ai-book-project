# Chapter 1 - Opening

## First Line
Someone looking over protagonist's shoulder at their computer asks: **"What are you optimizing for?"**

## The Scene
- Protagonist at workstation
- Partner/colleague arrives, looks over shoulder
- Asks the opening question
- Protagonist explains the optimization problem

## The Optimization Problem
Genetic balancing/ideal selection of gene diversity for self-replicating nursery pods
- Part of civilization starter kit program (mass pods sent to viable planets)
- Low individual pod success rate but high aggregate probability across many planets
- Technical/minute optimization, not grand strategy

## What Gets Revealed
Through protagonist's explanation:
- What this society cares about (survival via interstellar hedging)
- How protagonist gets paid / earns money
- What their job is
- Who hired them and why
- The world's priorities and values (optimization, A/B testing, meritocracy)

## Protagonist Backstory to Introduce
- Newly assigned to this position
- Got it through meritocracy - did something extraordinary in previous job
- Partner will ask about that previous achievement

## World Details to Show
- Idaho desert setting, arid climate
- Resource constraints visible
- Optimization/A/B testing culture
- Tech-governed society (global consolidation)
- Tracking mandatory (born with tracking shot)

## Questions to Answer
1. **Program status:** How far along is the nursery pod/starter kit program?
   - Tech just proven? Building phase? Already launched? Fully operational?

2. **Partner character:** Who is this person?
   - Name? Relationship to protagonist? Personality?

3. **Protagonist details:**
   - Name? Gender? Age?
   - What was the extraordinary achievement in previous job?
   - What kind of expertise do they have?

4. **The specific optimization:**
   - What's the exact loss function protagonist is minimizing?
   - What genetic parameters matter for self-replication success?
   - What's the constraint/tradeoff they're navigating?

5. **Setting specifics:**
   - Where exactly are they? Office? Lab? Remote?
   - Time of day? Environmental details to show resource pressure?
   - What's on the screen/workstation?
