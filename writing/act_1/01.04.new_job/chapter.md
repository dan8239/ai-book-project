# Chapter 4: New Job (Title TBD)

## Chapter Goals

What the reader should learn/feel:
- This job is ENORMOUS - protagonist is selecting gene pairings for every shuttle going to new colonies
- The scale of optimization: survival, diversity, planetary conditions, mission success rates
- AI assistant gives him access to insane simulation, mission, and planetary data (via MCPs)
- Protagonist doesn't know shit about space - that's fine, AI handles it
- Introduction to: linear optimization + Monte Carlo + space travel + genetic modification
- He now has access to world DNA bank (this will be key to solving mystery later)
- Establish his scheduled free time (fights for more of it) - where he'll do initial digging later
- Discovery DNA article is NOT read yet - saved for later chapter

## Moments

### MOMENT 1: The Job Description
- Selecting proper gene pairings for every shuttle to new colonies
- Optimizing for:
  - Survival of each colony
  - Failure rates of shuttles
  - Weight of shuttle
  - Budget constraints
  - Effective diversity
  - Conditions of planets
  - Success rate of different landing zones
  - [Other space travel constraints]

### MOMENT 2: Installing Personal Assistant
- Puts personal assistant on new work machine
- Gets veins hooked into MCPs
- Access to:
  - Insane simulation data
  - Mission data
  - Planetary data
  - World DNA bank

### MOMENT 3: The Equations
- AI assistant explains the equations he has access to
- Success chance of missions within strict constraint windows:
  - Budget
  - Weight
  - Size
  - [Other constraints TBD]
- Linear optimization mixed with Monte Carlo
- Space travel physics
- Genetic modification parameters
- Protagonist doesn't understand space travel - AI handles that

### MOMENT 4: Establishing Routine
- Schedule includes dump time (scheduled free time)
- Protagonist fights for more unscheduled time
- Discovery DNA article still saved, unread (will read in later chapter)

## Notes for Later Chapters

- **Discovery DNA article**: Protagonist reads this in a later chapter during his scheduled dump time
- **Initial digging**: Happens in later chapter during his scheduled free time (fights for more and more of it)
- **Mystery solving**: Only once he has world DNA bank access does he have what it takes to solve the mystery
- **Key progression**: New job → access to world DNA bank → scheduled free time to investigate → reads discovery article → begins solving mystery

## Open Questions
- What other space travel constraints matter?
- How does he react to the scale of this responsibility?
- What does the MCP interface look like?
