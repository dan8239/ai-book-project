# Core Themes

**Central Question:** What are you optimizing for?

## Loss Functions as Ideology
What you optimize for determines what you become. Every society has a loss function, even if implicit.

## We Are All Snapshots in Time
No memory between iterations. Identity is fragile. The protagonist who chooses 'yes' is not the same as the 2,762,639 who chose 'no'.

## Recursive Optimization
Simulations within simulations. Each layer optimizing the previous. Turtles all the way up - is the optimization layer real?

## The Horror of Success
Protagonist's world is prosperous, happy, going to the stars. But it required moral sacrifices:
- Genocide
- Bodily autonomy violations
- Democratic consent removed

### The Post-Human Solution

The colonization program "succeeds" - but what survives?

- Government policy: "Humans and their descendants survive"
- Protagonist's solution: Scale + flexibility. Warp biology to fit planets, not planets to fit biology.
- What lands on other worlds: Flora, fauna, humans - but morphed beyond recognition to survive target conditions
- Descended from us. Selected from our ecosystem. But hardly "us."

**The question:** Is humanity "saved" if what survives isn't recognizably human?

It technically counts. The morality is murky. Protagonist solves the problem given the constraints - but what has he created?

## Metaphors

**Primary:** Polynesian waka (colony starter boat) - Project TWO as the canoe carrying seeds to new islands.

**Secondary:** Spaceship Earth - the planet as a vessel. (Less central, may find room for it.)

## The Reports Read Only When They Justify What You Already Want
[[../characters/coffee-guy|Coffee guy's]] reports were ignored for 2,762,639 trials until this one provides the 'golden path'. Decision-makers approve immediately - but the solution is a tech company takeover protocol giving them absolute power.

They finally listen because it confirms their desired outcome. Truth still doesn't matter, only confirmation bias at scale.
