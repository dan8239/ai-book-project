# Core Themes

**Central Question:** What are you optimizing for?

## Loss Functions as Ideology
What you optimize for determines what you become. Every society has a loss function, even if implicit.

## We Are All Snapshots in Time
No memory between iterations. Identity is fragile. The protagonist who chooses 'yes' is not the same as the 2,762,639 who chose 'no'.

## Recursive Optimization
Simulations within simulations. Each layer optimizing the previous. Turtles all the way up - is the optimization layer real?

## The Horror of Success
Protagonist's world is prosperous, happy, going to the stars. But it required moral sacrifices:
- Genocide
- Bodily autonomy violations
- Democratic consent removed

## The Reports Read Only When They Justify What You Already Want
[[../characters/coffee-guy|Coffee guy's]] reports were ignored for 2,762,639 trials until this one provides the 'golden path'. Decision-makers approve immediately - but the solution is a tech company takeover protocol giving them absolute power.

They finally listen because it confirms their desired outcome. Truth still doesn't matter, only confirmation bias at scale.
