# Protagonist's Discovery Path

**Method:** Genetic/statistical analysis reveals population was bootstrapped from subsample.

## Clue Sequence

### 1. Memory Allocation Error
**When:** Act 1 - requests planetary simulation memory

**Reveals:**
- Pool total: 200 ZB (impossibly large for 2100s tech)

### 2. Ancient Operating System
**When:** Act 1 - examines allocation details

**Reveals:**
- Ubuntu 20.04 from 2020, Linux 5.15 from 2021
- Build timestamp: 2025-03-15
- Running in ~2300s - OS is 275+ years old?

### 3. Time Dilation
**When:** Act 1 - watches host timestamps

**Reveals:**
- 10 sim minutes = 5 milliseconds host time
- Ratio: ~111,500:1
- Entire civilization runs in minutes on host machine

### 4. Archaeological CPU Discovery
**When:** Act 1 - [[../characters/devsecops-woman|DevSecOps's]] message from the past

**Reveals:**
- Contains real seed data from 2025
- File metadata shows `/mnt/seed_data/` path
- Immutable, read-only, creation date 2025-03-15

### 5. DNA Population Anomaly
**When:** Act 1 - compares archaeological data to current population

**Reveals:**
- 90% of rare variants trace to seed dataset
- Variant age clusters at consolidation date
- Missing 99% of expected rare variation
- Effective Ne: 50,000 (not 10 million claimed)
- Population was bootstrapped from subsample

## Full Realization
**When:** Act 2 - Combines all clues, understands they're in simulation
