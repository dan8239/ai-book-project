# Temporal Clues

Time dilation and timestamp anomalies.

## Time Dilation Discovery

**When:** Protagonist watches host timestamps during investigation

**Reveals:**
- 10 sim minutes = 5 milliseconds host time
- Ratio: ~111,500:1
- Entire civilization runs in minutes on host machine

## Timestamp Inconsistencies

Multiple systems show build dates from 2025:
- Agent configs
- Seed data files
- OS kernel

All pre-date The Refactor by definition - these are the systems that RUN the simulation.

## Chapter Break Timestamps

*Motif: Ambiguous numbers at chapter breaks revealed later to be milliseconds on host machine.*

What looks like arbitrary formatting is actually real-time markers showing how little time passes in the real world while entire chapters of simulated life occur.
