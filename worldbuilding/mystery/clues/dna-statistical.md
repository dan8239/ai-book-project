# DNA & Statistical Clues

Population genetics anomalies that reveal the simulation's bootstrapped origin.

## The Population Bottleneck

**What protagonist notices:** Running evolutionary simulations on the old DNA dataset reveals impossible population bottleneck and demographic skew in the 'origin' generation.

### The Numbers Don't Add Up

| Metric | Expected | Actual | Implication |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------|
| Effective population size (Ne) | 10 million | 50,000 | Massive bottleneck |
| Rare variant sources | Distributed globally | 90% trace to seed dataset | Single origin |
| Variant age clustering | Gradual distribution | Clusters at Refactor date | Artificial seeding |
| Expected rare variation | 100% | 1% present | Missing diversity |

### Demographic Skew

The "origin population" isn't a representative sample of humanity:

- **Demographics:** Affluent, very online, types who sent DNA to 23andMe or similar services
- **Geographic bias:** Concentrated in specific regions, not globally distributed
- **Self-selected subset:** People who opted into consumer genetics testing

### What This Proves

1. **100% of current population** descended from same exact sample
2. **Sample is NOT worldwide** - demographically and geographically biased
3. **Dataset was bootstrapped** to create fake genetic variation, but metadata reveals the bottleneck

### The Horror

In the simulation, this subsample is presented as the origin of the entire human population. The metadata proves it was just wherever full data scans/DNA samples were sufficient to approximate a real human model.

### Red Herring Potential

Before full realization, this could suggest:
- Targeted culling of society during The Refactor
- Eugenics program selecting who reproduces
- Genocide cover-up (only ~50k effective ancestors survived)

The truth is worse - the entire world is simulated.
