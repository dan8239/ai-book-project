# The Archaeological CPU

## What It Appears To Be
Old server with DNA data from before [[../timeline/consolidation-event|consolidation]].

**What protagonist thinks:** Archaeological data of interest for studying baseline human behavior - pre-consolidation 'wild' humans (before tracking, selection, optimization).

## What It Actually Is
Present-day genetic data from before simulation/consolidation - the **origin dataset** that bootstrapped the simulation.

## The Message
[[../characters/devsecops-woman|DevSecOps woman]] planted the origin dataset itself - the actual genetic data that bootstrapped the simulation.

### What It Proves

1. **100% of current population** descended from same exact sample

2. **Sample is NOT worldwide** - demographically and geographically biased subsample of real world

3. **Dataset was bootstrapped** to create fake genetic variation, but metadata reveals the bottleneck

### The Subsample Characteristics
- **Demographics:** Affluent, very online, types who sent DNA to 23andMe or similar services
- **Geographic bias:** Not evenly distributed across world - concentrated in specific regions
- **Metadata reveals:** This isn't baseline human variation - it's a specific self-selected subset
- **How identified:** Metadata analysis shows population markers inconsistent with global distribution

### The Horror
In the simulation, this subsample is presented as the origin of the entire human population. But the metadata proves it was just wherever full data scans/DNA samples were sufficient to approximate a real human model.

## How Protagonist Discovers
Running evolutionary simulations on the dataset, notices impossible population bottleneck and demographic skew in the 'origin' generation.
