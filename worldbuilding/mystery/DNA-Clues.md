# The Old DNA Dataset

## What It Appears To Be
Old server with DNA data from before [[../timeline/the-refactor|The Refactor]].

## What It Actually Is
Present-day genetic data from before simulation/Refactor - the **origin dataset** that bootstrapped the simulation. It has whatever 23andMe type companies have. Current day humans plus the mapped genomes and some historical data

### What It Proves

1. **100% of current population** descended from same exact sample
2. **Sample is NOT worldwide** - demographically and geographically biased subsample of real world
3. **Dataset was bootstrapped** to create fake genetic variation, but metadata reveals the bottleneck

### The Subsample Characteristics
- **Demographics:** Affluent, very online, types who sent DNA to 23andMe or similar services
- **Geographic bias:** Not evenly distributed across world - concentrated in specific regions
- **Metadata reveals:** This isn't baseline human variation - it's a specific self-selected subset
- **How identified:** Metadata analysis shows population markers inconsistent with global distribution

### The Horror
In the simulation, this subsample is presented as the origin of the entire human population. But the metadata proves it was just wherever full data scans/DNA samples were sufficient to approximate a real human model.

### Red Herring

This speaks to potentially a more targeted culling of society. We always thought it was an opt in, but this seems geographically and demographically biased sample. Show a plot

## How Protagonist Discovers
Running evolutionary simulations on the dataset, notices impossible population bottleneck and demographic skew in the 'origin' generation.
