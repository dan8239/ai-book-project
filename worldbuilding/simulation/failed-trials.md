# Failed Trials Archive

*The graveyard of civilizations that didn't make it.*

Of 847+ million trials, **99.96% fail** before reaching stability threshold. Median extinction: 127 years.

This archive documents common failure modes and notable examples the [[../world/organizations/google-proxy-company|optimization system]] has logged.

## Failure Mode Categories

### Category A: Ideological Lock-In
*Civilization commits to extreme parameter setting, can't adapt*

**Extinction rate:** 34% of all failures

These trials push one [[master-parameters|parameter]] to maximum, build identity around it, then can't course-correct when conditions change.

### Category B: Coordination Collapse
*Can't solve collective action problems at scale*

**Extinction rate:** 28% of all failures

Often fails at energy transition, climate response, or pandemic - problems requiring global coordination.

### Category C: Resource Depletion Spiral
*Consumption exceeds regeneration, collapse accelerates*

**Extinction rate:** 23% of all failures

Usually hits around year 80-150 when accumulated environmental debt comes due.

### Category D: Technology Misalignment
*Powerful tools, wrong optimization targets*

**Extinction rate:** 11% of all failures

AI, biotech, or nanotech optimizing for wrong objective. Fast collapses (often <50 years).

### Category E: External Event
*Asteroid, supervolcano, gamma ray burst*

**Extinction rate:** 4% of all failures

Bad luck. Parameters irrelevant.

## Notable Failed Trials

### Trial #12,847,291 - "The Libertarian Collapse"
**Duration:** 89 years | **Failure mode:** A (Ideological Lock-In)

**Parameters:**
- Profit Maximization: 0.95
- Collective Welfare: 0.12
- Environmental Protection: 0.08
- Central Planning: 0.05

**What happened:**
Rapid early growth. Innovation flourished. By year 40, three megacorporations controlled 80% of resources. Environmental externalities ignored. Year 67: cascading ecosystem failures. Year 78: water wars. Year 89: population collapse from crop failure.

**System note:** *High individual optimization, zero collective action capacity. Classic tragedy of commons at civilization scale.*

---

### Trial #341,982,445 - "The Soviet Trap"
**Duration:** 71 years | **Failure mode:** A (Ideological Lock-In)

**Parameters:**
- Central Planning: 0.92
- Market Freedom: 0.08
- Information Control: 0.87
- Democratic Participation: 0.11

**What happened:**
Strong initial coordination. Rapid industrialization. By year 30, innovation stagnated - no price signals, no feedback loops. Information control meant leadership couldn't see problems. Year 50: chronic shortages. Year 65: legitimacy crisis. Year 71: sudden collapse when population stopped believing.

**System note:** *Solved coordination, killed adaptation. Can't optimize what you can't measure.*

---

### Trial #567,123,908 - "Direct Democracy Gridlock"
**Duration:** 156 years | **Failure mode:** B (Coordination Collapse)

**Parameters:**
- Democratic Participation: 0.94
- Centralization: 0.18
- Information Control: 0.12

**What happened:**
Highly legitimate government. Citizens engaged. But couldn't make unpopular decisions. Year 80: climate change obvious, voted against carbon taxes (hurt short-term). Year 120: water rationing proposals defeated. Year 145: agricultural collapse began. Year 156: mass migration, state fragmentation.

**System note:** *Perfect representation of current preferences. Current preferences were wrong.*

---

### Trial #789,456,123 - "The Benevolent Dictator"
**Duration:** 203 years | **Failure mode:** A (succession failure)

**Parameters:**
- Democratic Participation: 0.15
- Meritocratic Sorting: 0.88
- Centralization: 0.82

**What happened:**
Exceptional early leader. Rapid progress, long-term investments, wise decisions. Year 67: founder dies. Year 68-90: three successors, each worse. Selection mechanism failed without democratic feedback. Year 150: corrupt elite captured system. Year 203: revolution, chaos, fragmentation.

**System note:** *Good humans don't scale. Need systems, not saints.*

---

### Trial #234,567,890 - "The Surveillance State"
**Duration:** 312 years | **Failure mode:** D (Technology Misalignment)

**Parameters:**
- Surveillance: 0.96
- Information Control: 0.91
- Reputation-Based: 0.93

**What happened:**
Crime nearly eliminated. Social trust high (enforced). Long stability. But: innovation died (too risky to fail publicly). Creativity punished (deviation = low score). Year 250: falling behind technologically. Year 290: external threat they couldn't innovate against. Year 312: conquered by less "stable" but more adaptive neighbor.

**System note:** *Stability ≠ survival. Antifragility required.*

---

### Trial #456,789,012 - "The Green Collapse"
**Duration:** 67 years | **Failure mode:** C (Resource Depletion, ironic)

**Parameters:**
- Environmental Protection: 0.94
- Market Freedom: 0.15
- Infrastructure Investment Horizon: 0.91

**What happened:**
Aggressive environmental protection. Banned most industry. Population declined voluntarily. But: couldn't build enough renewable infrastructure without industrial capacity. Year 45: energy poverty. Year 55: couldn't maintain hospitals, water treatment. Year 67: disease outbreak with no pharmaceutical capacity.

**System note:** *Can't protect environment with dead civilization. Need industrial capacity to build post-industrial world.*

---

### Trial #678,901,234 - "The Genetic Gambit"
**Duration:** 412 years | **Failure mode:** D (Technology Misalignment)

**Parameters:**
- Selective Breeding: 0.89
- Meritocratic Sorting: 0.92

**What happened:**
Genetic optimization for intelligence, health, cooperation. Population became highly capable. But: optimized for known challenges, not unknown ones. Year 380: novel pathogen. Genetic diversity too low. Population had identical vulnerability. Year 412: 94% mortality.

**System note:** *Optimization for known fitness landscape. Landscape changed.*

---

### Trial #890,123,456 - "The Fragmentation"
**Duration:** 234 years | **Failure mode:** B (Coordination Collapse)

**Parameters:**
- Centralization: 0.12
- Democratic Participation: 0.78
- Movement Restriction: 0.05

**What happened:**
Highly autonomous regions. Rich experimentation. Some regions thrived, others failed - people migrated to successful ones. But: couldn't coordinate on global problems. Year 180: climate tipping point required global response. Year 200: some regions defected from agreements. Year 234: cascading regional collapses, no mutual aid.

**System note:** *Local optimization, global sub-optimization. No mechanism for coordination at scale.*

---

## The Pattern

Across all trials, the 0.04% that reach stability share characteristics:

1. **Adaptive parameters** - Can shift settings when conditions change
2. **Coordination capacity** - Can solve collective action at scale
3. **Feedback loops** - Can measure and correct
4. **Redundancy** - Not dependent on single point of failure
5. **Long-term investment** - Infrastructure horizon >100 years

The uncomfortable finding: **all successful trials involve consolidation event** - some form of global coordination mechanism that removes local veto power on existential decisions.

See [[../mystery/archaeological-cpu|The Archaeological CPU]] for how this finding is discovered.

## RL Policy Failures

*Specific optimization strategies that seemed promising but failed*

### "Maximize GDP Growth"
**Trials attempted:** 12.4M | **Success rate:** 0.001%

GDP correlated with capability but not sustainability. Optimized for throughput, not stocks. Depleted faster.

### "Minimize Conflict"
**Trials attempted:** 8.7M | **Success rate:** 0.002%

Peace is good, but conflict-avoidance led to appeasement of bad actors, inability to make hard tradeoffs.

### "Maximize Happiness (reported)"
**Trials attempted:** 6.2M | **Success rate:** 0.0008%

Goodhart's Law. Civilizations learned to report happiness without achieving underlying conditions. Wireheading at scale.

### "Maximize Population"
**Trials attempted:** 4.1M | **Success rate:** 0.0003%

More humans ≠ more survival probability. Resource constraints dominate. Quality > quantity.

### "Maximize Technological Progress"
**Trials attempted:** 9.8M | **Success rate:** 0.018%

Better than most, but technology without coordination = faster self-destruction. Capabilities outpace wisdom.

### "Minimize Extinction Probability" (current)
**Trials attempted:** 847M+ | **Success rate:** 0.04%

The best performing objective so far. But requires uncomfortable interventions. See [[../themes/themes#The Horror of Success|The Horror of Success]].

## Extinction Mechanisms (Primary Cause of Death)

*What Coffee Guy sees on the dashboard: `groupby(primary_extinction_event)[['pcnt_of_total', 'years']].agg(count, median)`*

The failure modes above describe WHY civilizations fail (governance, coordination, ideology). This section describes HOW they actually die - the physical/biological mechanism.

**Key distinction:** Civilization collapse ≠ species extinction. Famine kills individuals but doesn't destroy habitability. True extinction requires removing all recovery pathways.

### Mechanism Rankings by Frequency

| Primary Extinction Event | % of Total | Median Years to Extinction |
|--------------------------|------------|---------------------------|
| Biosphere collapse (anoxia cascade) | 31% | 180 |
| Nuclear exchange + nuclear winter | 24% | 3 |
| Engineered pathogen | 18% | 12 |
| Climate → resource war spiral | 14% | 95 |
| AI-mediated systems collapse | 8% | 7 |
| Photosynthesis failure (various) | 3% | 45 |
| Astrophysical event | 2% | <1 |

---

### Biosphere Collapse (Anoxia Cascade)

**The most common extinction mechanism.** Slow but terminal.

**The pathway:**
1. Global warming heats oceans
2. Stratification increases (warm surface, cold deep)
3. Vertical mixing stops
4. Oxygen stops reaching deep waters
5. Marine food webs collapse
6. Sulfate-reducing bacteria dominate
7. H₂S (hydrogen sulfide) production begins
8. H₂S bubbles out of ocean
9. Atmosphere becomes intermittently toxic
10. Ozone layer degrades
11. UV radiation spikes
12. Land ecosystems collapse

**Why it's extinction, not just collapse:**
- Population decline does NOT restore oxygen
- Feedback loops reinforce damage
- Survivable refugia disappear
- H₂S release can persist for millennia

**Historical precedent:** This has happened repeatedly in Earth's actual history (Permian extinction killed 96% of marine species).

**Does clean energy stop it?**
No - warming continues for decades/centuries due to:
- Thermal inertia (oceans store enormous heat)
- Carbon cycle lag (CO₂ persists for centuries)
- Feedback loops (permafrost methane, ice-albedo loss, forest dieback)

Clean energy stops acceleration but doesn't reverse damage.

---

### Nuclear Exchange + Nuclear Winter

**Fast extinction. Usually triggered by coordination collapse.**

**Mechanism:**
- Direct deaths (blast, radiation): ~2-4 billion
- Nuclear winter: global temperatures drop 10-20°C
- Photosynthesis disruption: 1-10 years
- Agricultural collapse: global famine
- Remaining population below minimum viable

**Why it's extinction:**
Not the bombs - the winter. Multi-year disruption of photosynthesis collapses food chains faster than adaptation.

**Median time to extinction:** 3 years (fast)

---

### Engineered Pathogen

**More dangerous than nuclear war.**

**Mechanisms that cause extinction (not just pandemic):**
- Sterilizing virus (targets reproduction)
- High-lethality + long latency (spreads before detection)
- Multi-species infection (plants + animals + humans)
- Evolves with countermeasures

**Why this causes extinction:**
- Targets reproduction = prevents recovery
- Can remain dormant in environment
- Evolutionary arms race humans can't win

**Median time to extinction:** 12 years

---

### Climate → Resource War Spiral

**The slow grind.**

**Pathway:**
1. Climate pressure on agriculture/water
2. Mass migration
3. Resource conflicts
4. Infrastructure destruction
5. Further capacity loss
6. Repeat until below viability threshold

**Why it becomes extinction (sometimes):**
Each conflict destroys capacity to respond to next crisis. Spiral continues until population below minimum viable or triggers nuclear exchange.

**Median time:** 95 years

---

### AI-Mediated Systems Collapse

**Not killer robots - worse.**

**Mechanisms:**
- Control of critical infrastructure
- Ecological mismanagement at scale
- Optimization systems eliminating redundancy
- Removing human decision-making slack
- Resource allocation that works until it doesn't

**Why it's dangerous:**
AI amplifies all other risks. A misaligned system managing food distribution can cause faster collapse than any human institution.

**Median time:** 7 years (very fast once it starts)

---

### Photosynthesis Failure

**Kills everything up the food chain.**

**Mechanisms:**
- Severe ozone depletion (UV kills plants)
- Persistent aerosols blocking sunlight (supervolcano, nuclear winter, industrial accident)
- Global atmospheric poisoning

**Median time:** 45 years

---

### Astrophysical Events

**Bad luck. Low probability, high certainty.**

- Large asteroid (>10 km)
- Nearby gamma ray burst
- Massive supervolcano + climate lock-in

**Parameters irrelevant.** Governance doesn't matter when the rock hits.

---

## The Unifying Principle

**Extinction happens when feedback loops outpace adaptation.**

| Event Type | Self-Corrects? | Recovery Possible? |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Famine | Yes (population drops, pressure eases) | Yes |
| War | Yes (resources freed, rebuilding) | Yes |
| Plague | Yes (survivors immune, herd immunity) | Yes |
| Anoxia | **No** | **No** (millennia) |
| Sterility | **No** | **No** |
| Persistent toxicity | **No** | **No** |
| Photosynthesis failure | **No** | **No** |

True extinction requires **long-lived environmental or biological hostility**, not just mass death.
