# Master Parameters

The simulation tunes these parameters across trials. Each represents a dial that can be set anywhere on a spectrum - extremes in either direction tend to cause collapse.

## The Insight

No single parameter setting is "correct." The [[optimization-mechanics|optimization system]] searches for combinations that achieve stability.

Most trials fail because they:
1. Push one parameter too far (ideology)
2. Can't adapt parameters when conditions change
3. Create feedback loops that accelerate toward extremes

See [[failed-trials|Failed Trials Archive]] for specific examples.
