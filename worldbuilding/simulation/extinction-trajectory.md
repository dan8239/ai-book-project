# Extinction Trajectory

The actual path humanity is on - what's public knowledge vs. what's classified.

## The History (What Happened)

### Peak Population: 18-20 Billion

World population peaked mid-21st century. Resource pressures were already critical:
- Water wars beginning
- Grain belt failures
- Mass climate migration

### The Trigger: Nuclear Exchange

#needs-work - Details on which conflict, scope, how it accelerated the timeline

A limited nuclear exchange occurred. Not full MAD, but enough to:
- Inject massive particulates into atmosphere
- Disrupt global food systems for years
- Accelerate existing tensions
- **Make the trajectory undeniable**

This is what created the call to action for [[../characters/zuckminster-fullerine|Zuckminster]] and [[../world/organizations/quant|Quant]]. The simulations weren't theoretical anymore - they were urgent.

### The Models Were Wrong

**What scientists predicted:** Gradual warming, manageable with adaptation, stabilization possible.

**What actually happened:**

1. **Clathrate destabilization** - Methane hydrates on ocean floor released faster than any model predicted. Added 5-8°C on top of other warming.

2. **Stratocumulus cloud breakup** - At ~1,200ppm CO2, low marine clouds collapsed. These had been reflecting massive amounts of sunlight. Their loss added another 8°C almost instantly.

3. **The cascade locked in** - By the time anyone understood what was happening, +12-14°C was committed.

### Present Day (Coffee Guy's Era, 2025)

The trajectory is known. The simulations are running. The question isn't "will this happen" but "what policy gives the best survival odds."

This is why the takeover protocol exists. This is what [[../characters/zuckminster-fullerine|Zuckminster]] is optimizing for.

## The Current State (Protagonist's Era, ~2225)

### What's Gone

| Category | Status |
|----------|--------|
| **Polar ice** | Completely gone - no Arctic, no Antarctic ice sheets |
| **Ocean life** | Basically dead - 95%+ marine species extinct |
| **Coastal cities** | Gone - Miami, New York, Shanghai, Mumbai underwater |
| **Equatorial zone** | Uninhabitable - wet-bulb temps lethal year-round |
| **Biodiversity** | Catastrophic - megafauna extinct, most species gone |

### Sea Level Rise

Using maximum error bands from current models: **+25-30 meters**

Major impacts:
- Florida: Gone
- Netherlands: Gone
- Bangladesh: Gone
- Most major coastal cities: Underwater or abandoned
- New coastlines 50-200km inland in flat areas

#needs-work - Get actual map/visualization showing modified coastlines

### Temperature

Global average: +12-14°C above pre-industrial

What this means:
- Equator to ~35° latitude: Lethal wet-bulb temps seasonally or permanently
- Temperate zones: Now subtropical/tropical
- Former Arctic/Antarctic: Now temperate, but poor soil
- Growing zones shifted poleward onto glacial till

### Growing Zones

| Region | Pre-Collapse | Current |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| US Midwest | Breadbasket | Desert/dust bowl |
| Canadian Shield | Boreal forest | Attempting agriculture (poor soil) |
| Siberia | Permafrost | Attempting agriculture (poor soil) |
| Amazon | Rainforest | Savanna/desert |
| Mediterranean | Agriculture | Desert |
| Northern Europe | Agriculture | Too hot, shifting north |

#needs-work - Map showing crop zones today vs. future

**The soil problem:** Newly arable zones in high latitudes have glacial till, not topsoil. Takes centuries to develop. You can grow food there, but yields are 1/3 of old breadbaskets.

### Population Trajectory

```
Peak:        18-20 billion (mid-21st century)
Post-nuclear: 12-15 billion
Post-cascade: 8-10 billion (rapid die-off from food collapse)
Current:      2-3 billion (and falling)
```

### Sulfur Events

H₂S venting from anoxic oceans. Currently in Phase 3:
- Permanent toxic zones on most coastlines
- Events pushing further inland each year
- "Sulfide storms" can carry H₂S 50-100km from coast
- Bodies found in valleys, basements (H₂S pools in low areas)

See [[post-refactor-society#The Anoxia Threat|Anoxia Threat]] for details.

## The Guillotine (Classified Knowledge)

**What the public believes:**
- Population will stabilize at 10M-1B
- High-latitude, high-altitude habitats are sustainable
- Humanity survives, diminished but viable
- Colonization is expansion, not evacuation

**What higher clearance reveals:**

### The Ozone Collapse

H₂S doesn't just poison directly - it destroys the ozone layer.

**The chemistry:** H₂S + O₃ → breakdown products. As more H₂S vents to atmosphere, ozone depletes.

**Current status:** Ozone already degraded ~40%. UV-B elevated. Skin cancer epidemic, crop stress.

**The trajectory:** Models show complete ozone collapse within 50-100 years.

### What Complete Ozone Collapse Means

Without ozone protection:
- UV-B and UV-C reach surface at sterilizing levels
- Land plants die from radiation damage
- Phytoplankton (remaining) die
- Outdoor exposure lethal within hours
- Topsoil sterilizes (kills soil microbiome)
- Food production becomes impossible even in "safe" zones

### The Extinction Math

**Post-ozone collapse projection:**

```
Years 0-20:  Sealed habitat survivors only, 100M → 10M
Years 20-50: Energy infrastructure decay, 10M → 100K
Years 50-100: Equipment failure cascade, 100K → 10K
Years 100+:  Stone age remnants or nothing
```

**Two possible endpoints:**

1. **Tech elite remnants** - Small populations in sealed habitats, shrinking as equipment fails, energy production decays, maintenance becomes impossible. Each generation has less. Eventually unsustainable.

2. **Stone age survivors** - High-latitude, mostly-underground populations subsisting on fungi and what can grow in filtered light. No civilization. No recovery. Permanent dark age or slow extinction.

### Why Colonization Is The Only Path

You can't:
- Fix the ozone (H₂S production can't be stopped)
- Engineer resistance (UV sterilizes everything)
- Seal enough habitats (energy decay inevitable)
- Wait it out (recovery takes millions of years)

You can only leave.

The colonization program isn't about expansion. It's about whether ANY humans survive.

## How This Is Exposed In Story

[[../characters/protagonist|Protagonist]] is focused on "making the faucet bigger" - optimizing yield. He's not deeply versed in the historical causes.

[[../characters/temp-trainee|The temp/trainee]] he's getting up to speed is a statistical/PhD type who knows the macro picture. Through training sessions, the temp explains in remedial terms:
- How we got here (cloud breakup, models wrong)
- The population trajectory
- The food math

This exposition lets readers understand the world state without protagonist being a climate expert.

## What Protagonist Learns

### Before Promotion

Standard scientist view (what the temp knows, what most people believe):
- "We'll stabilize somewhere between 10M and 1B"
- "High latitude habitats are sustainable"
- "Colonization is insurance, not necessity"
- "Humanity survives, just smaller"

Protagonist focuses on optimization, not causes. He thinks the problem is solvable if he can just make yields higher.

### After Promotion (Higher Clearance)

The guillotine:
- Ozone collapse is coming
- No stable endpoint exists on Earth
- Current population is in managed decline toward extinction
- The only question is whether colonization succeeds before collapse

**This is the mystery escalation** - he thought he was optimizing for long-term survival on a damaged Earth. He discovers he's optimizing for evacuation before the final collapse.

### The Horrible Realization

The colonization genetics work he's doing isn't to help humanity thrive on new worlds.

It's to ensure ANYONE survives at all.

And his simulation might be one of the ones that gets terminated because the policy extracted from it doesn't improve survival odds.
