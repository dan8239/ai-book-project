# Technology

## Quantum Processing (QPU)
- Runs the simulations
- 200 ZB memory pool (impossibly large for even 2100s tech)
- Enables 847+ million simultaneous trials

## AI Agents
- General intelligence, widely customizable and flexible
- Embedded into every product
- [[../world/organizations/google-proxy-company|Company]] runs instances for everyone's agents, every SaaS product
- This is how [[../characters/protagonist|protagonist]] builds his team

### Agent Characteristics
- [[../characters/claude-assistants|Claude assistants]] have athlete nicknames
- Trained on user interaction history
- Swear, no filter (customized)
- Work asynchronously on long projects
- Self-organizing

### The University That Never Dies
The agents are like a university that keeps getting bigger and deeper and smarter but the staff never dies unless they're totally obsolete. They train the next generation of specialized ones.

### AI Agents as Simulated Humans
The agents are becoming essentially simulated humans:
- Nature/nurture with the data they see
- Layers they get to have (skillset/brain analogy)
- Then they go through reinforcement learning with all the previously replicated entities in their huge database

## physical manifestation of agents
1. Mostly just meet up with people virtually (e.g. go to the office is just like tap in at the same time)
2. Physically people just drop in and out and disappear from these virtual engagements
3. Agents are physically represented visually so you can distinguish them
4. [[../themes/red-herrings]] about the protagonist being an agent. It's actually much worse than that his whole world is fake
5. He can visit his family virtually (museum scene, etc.)
6. The virtual arena is how we engage with the 

## DNA Systems
- Extensive DNA collection on everyone born post-Refactor
- GWAS (genome-wide association studies)
- Population genetics modeling
- Statistical inference from DNA

## Time Dilation
- 10 sim minutes = 5 milliseconds host time
- Ratio: ~111,500:1
- Entire civilization runs in minutes on host machine
