# Project Te Waka Ora

**Alias:** Project TWO (double meaning - the second try of human civilization)

The space colonization effort. Not expansion - escape.

Named for the Polynesian voyagers who colonized the Pacific islands, carrying portable ecosystems in their canoes - taro, pigs, chickens, dogs. They didn't just move people; they moved entire biospheres.

## Why Colonization Exists

See [[extinction-trajectory#The Guillotine (Classified Knowledge)|The Guillotine]] for full context.

**The public story:** Mars colonization has already happened. It's just a science experiment out there. A few thousand moles living underground scraping microbes off of the tunnel walls. How could they pull from the food chain division for that?
**The classified truth:** Earth is a write-off. Ozone collapse is coming. Colonization is the only path where humans survive at all. Mars needs insane terraforming. Thousands of years. Not nearly enough time or carrying capacity. It's still dependent on imports from Earth. Mars is dead too.

## The Program

### What They're Doing

Mass nursery pods with robotic civilization starter kits sent to viable planets:
- Self-replicating systems
- Low individual success rate but high aggregate probability
- Genetic payload optimized for each target world

### The Math (Moral Quandary)

- Success rate per colony mission is decent (protagonist optimized it)
- But species survival requires X target colonies for redundancy
- To hit six sigma species survival, you need parallel attempts
- Each mission requires enormous energy/resources
- **The resource extraction would kill a huge percentage of Earth's remaining population**

Trade-off: Optimize for species survival = sacrifice current humans. [[../characters/protagonist|Protagonist]] is asked to run the numbers on how many people die so the species might survive.

## Protagonist's Job

From [[../characters/protagonist#Story Progression|Protagonist Story Progression]]:

1. **Starts:** Agricultural optimization job, food production at scale
2. **Call up:** Gets promoted to colonization/re-seed program - learns true dire state of Earth
3. **Mystery begins:** Needs genetic diversity for colony, finds weird dataset

### The Work

Selecting gene pairings for every shuttle going to new colonies. Optimizing for:
- Survival of each colony
- Failure rates of shuttles
- Weight of shuttle
- Budget constraints
- Effective genetic diversity
- Conditions of target planets
- Success rate of different landing zones

### Tools & Access

- Insane simulation data via AI assistant (MCPs)
- Mission data
- Planetary data
- **World DNA bank** (key to solving mystery later)

Linear optimization + Monte Carlo + space travel physics + genetic modification parameters.

Protagonist doesn't know shit about space - AI handles it. He's the optimization guy making the faucet bigger.

## The Technology

### Golden Path Solution

From [[optimization-mechanics|Optimization Mechanics]]:

- Nursery pods with robotic civilization starter kits
- Self-replicating systems
- Low individual success but high aggregate probability
- Automated policy enforcement
- Genetic seeding for other planets

### Why This Approach

**Can't you just fix Earth?**

See [[post-consolidation-society#Why Genetic Modification Can't Save Them|Why Genetic Modification Can't Save Them]]

- H₂S blocks cellular machinery in ALL aerobic life
- Would need to redesign electron transport chain (fundamental biochemistry)
- Would need to do it for ALL species simultaneously
- Can't rebuild entire ecosystem while it's collapsing

**Colonization is different because:**
- Starting fresh with newly-built biosphere
- Not fighting a poisoned, collapsing system
- Can engineer FEW species for new environment

## Timeline

| Phase | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| **Protagonist's era** | Active program, shuttles launching, genetic payloads being optimized |
| **Discovery** | Protagonist needs more genetic diversity, finds weird dataset in 23andMe-type DB |
| **Moral choice** | Must make callous decision for colonization (TBD - morph DNA beyond recognition?) |
| **Technical solution** | Technically solves colonization optimization |
| **The horror** | Learns epoch is ending, world will be erased - his work doesn't matter |

## Connection to Mystery

1. Working on colonization genetic payload
2. Government seed data has bottleneck problem - effective population too small
3. Needs older/more diverse genetic strains
4. Looks for specific datasets - relatives, extinct variants
5. Finds weird dataset - wrong location, old format, not properly ingested
6. This is where [[../characters/devsecops-woman|DevSecOps woman]] planted the message

## What Big Dog Is Watching

From [[../characters/Glenn "Big Dog" Robinson#Why He's Watching Protagonist|Big Dog]]:

Protagonist is getting close to the moral breakthrough needed for colonization success. Most of 847M trials fail at this point. This epoch has promising trials that will snowball results.

## Target Worlds

- **R⊕** = Earth radii
- **ESI** = Earth Similarity Index (0-1, higher = more Earth-like)
- **HZ** = Habitable Zone

### What We Know Now (2025)

Current detection methods can determine:
- **Distance** - Via parallax and stellar distance measurements
- **Mass** - Via radial velocity (minimum mass from wobble)
- **Radius** - Via transit depth (if transiting)
- **Orbital period** - From transit timing or radial velocity curves
- **Equilibrium temperature** - Calculated from stellar flux and assumed albedo
- **Host star type** - Spectral classification

**Limited or unknown:**
- Atmospheric composition (only for hot Jupiters and a few transiting planets)
- Surface conditions
- Magnetic field
- Axial tilt / seasons
- Actual surface temperature (depends on atmosphere)
- Geological activity
- Resource availability

| **Weather patterns** | Cloud tracking, storm detection | Medium |
| **UV/radiation surface flux** | Stellar monitoring + atmospheric modeling | High |

### Selection Criteria for Project TWO

For the nursery pod mission, target worlds need:

1. **Reachable** - Within practical travel time (affects success rate)
2. **Geothermal potential** - Energy for self-replicating systems
3. **Magnetic field** - Radiation shielding for biological payload
4. **Atmospheric potential** - Can hold or develop atmosphere
5. **Water availability** - Ice or vapor detected
6. **Stable star** - Low flare activity (most M-dwarfs fail this)
7. **Not tidally locked** - Or confirmed habitable terminator zone

**Best current candidates for Project TWO:**
1. Ross 128 b (quiet star, Earth-like)
2. Teegarden's Star b (highest ESI, but flare concerns)
3. TRAPPIST-1 e (Earth-like, but 7-planet resonance chain is fragile)
4. LHS 1140 b (dense, good for atmospheric retention)

**Tiered target approach:**
- **Primary targets (< 15 ly)**: Ross 128 b, Teegarden's Star b, GJ 1002 b
- **Secondary targets (15-50 ly)**: Wolf 1069 b, TRAPPIST-1 e/f, LHS 1140 b
- **Tertiary targets (> 50 ly)**: TOI-700 d, Kepler candidates (backup for redundancy)
