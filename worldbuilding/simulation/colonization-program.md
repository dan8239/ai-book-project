# Colonization Program

The space colonization effort. Not expansion - escape.

## Why Colonization Exists

See [[extinction-trajectory#The Guillotine (Classified Knowledge)|The Guillotine]] for full context.

**The public story:** Humanity expands to the stars, insurance policy for species survival.

**The classified truth:** Earth is a write-off. Ozone collapse is coming. Colonization is the only path where humans survive at all.

## The Program

### What They're Doing

Mass nursery pods with robotic civilization starter kits sent to viable planets:
- Self-replicating systems
- Low individual success rate but high aggregate probability
- Genetic payload optimized for each target world

### The Math (Moral Quandary)

- Success rate per colony mission is decent (protagonist optimized it)
- But species survival requires X target colonies for redundancy
- To hit 97% species survival, you need parallel attempts
- Each mission requires enormous energy/resources
- **The resource extraction would kill a huge percentage of Earth's remaining population**

Trade-off: Optimize for species survival = sacrifice current humans. [[../characters/protagonist|Protagonist]] is asked to run the numbers on how many people die so the species might survive.

## Protagonist's Job

From [[../characters/protagonist#Story Progression|Protagonist Story Progression]]:

1. **Starts:** Agricultural optimization job, food production at scale
2. **Call up:** Gets promoted to colonization/re-seed program - learns true dire state of Earth
3. **Mystery begins:** Needs genetic diversity for colony, finds weird dataset

### The Work

Selecting gene pairings for every shuttle going to new colonies. Optimizing for:
- Survival of each colony
- Failure rates of shuttles
- Weight of shuttle
- Budget constraints
- Effective genetic diversity
- Conditions of target planets
- Success rate of different landing zones

### Tools & Access

- Insane simulation data via AI assistant (MCPs)
- Mission data
- Planetary data
- **World DNA bank** (key to solving mystery later)

Linear optimization + Monte Carlo + space travel physics + genetic modification parameters.

Protagonist doesn't know shit about space - AI handles it. He's the optimization guy making the faucet bigger.

## The Technology

### Golden Path Solution

From [[optimization-mechanics|Optimization Mechanics]]:

- Nursery pods with robotic civilization starter kits
- Self-replicating systems
- Low individual success but high aggregate probability
- Automated policy enforcement
- Genetic seeding for other planets

### Why This Approach

**Can't you just fix Earth?**

See [[post-consolidation-society#Why Genetic Modification Can't Save Them|Why Genetic Modification Can't Save Them]]

- H₂S blocks cellular machinery in ALL aerobic life
- Would need to redesign electron transport chain (fundamental biochemistry)
- Would need to do it for ALL species simultaneously
- Can't rebuild entire ecosystem while it's collapsing

**Colonization is different because:**
- Starting fresh with newly-built biosphere
- Not fighting a poisoned, collapsing system
- Can engineer FEW species for new environment

## Timeline

| Phase | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| **Protagonist's era** | Active program, shuttles launching, genetic payloads being optimized |
| **Discovery** | Protagonist needs more genetic diversity, finds weird dataset in 23andMe-type DB |
| **Moral choice** | Must make callous decision for colonization (TBD - morph DNA beyond recognition?) |
| **Technical solution** | Technically solves colonization optimization |
| **The horror** | Learns epoch is ending, world will be erased - his work doesn't matter |

## Connection to Mystery

1. Working on colonization genetic payload
2. Government seed data has bottleneck problem - effective population too small
3. Needs older/more diverse genetic strains
4. Looks for specific datasets - relatives, extinct variants
5. Finds weird dataset - wrong location, old format, not properly ingested
6. This is where [[../characters/devsecops-woman|DevSecOps woman]] planted the message

## What Big Dog Is Watching

From [[../characters/Glenn "Big Dog" Robinson#Why He's Watching Protagonist|Big Dog]]:

Protagonist is getting close to the moral breakthrough needed for colonization success. Most of 847M trials fail at this point. This epoch has promising trials that will snowball results.

## Open Questions

#needs-work
- What specific moral choice is required for colonization?
- How many colonies needed for 97% species survival?
- What percentage of Earth population dies for the resource extraction?
- What does "morph DNA beyond recognition" mean specifically?
