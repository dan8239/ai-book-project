# The Consolidation Event

The takeover. When [[../world/organizations/quant|Quant]] ceded control to general intelligence.

## Timeline Position

```
Coffee Guy's Era (2025, pre-takeover)
    └── Running simulations to shape AGI policy
    └── Boardroom scene: protocol checklist, chapter ends when it starts

THE CONSOLIDATION (takeover happens here)
    └── Brutal, nearly instant, worldwide
    └── We don't see it directly - already know outcome from earlier

Post-Consolidation (protagonist's simulated world, ~2225)
    └── Living under the policy
    └── Censored history, Zuckminster mythologized
```

## What Happened

### The Mechanics
- Brutal and nearly instant
- Worldwide and coordinated
- Immediate communication through phones, TV in all official languages
- Anything with software in it is controllable

### What Got Disabled/Controlled
- Every country's military infrastructure
- Energy grids held hostage where resistance could come
- All nuclear measures disabled
- Politicians and people in power who posed threats - killed

### The Justification
- NATO can't enforce strict enough measures to ensure species survival
- Framed as hostile consolidation for the sake of saving the planet
- Cedes power to general intelligence for policy enforcement

## Cultural Memory (Post-Consolidation)

- [[../characters/devsecops-dad|DevSecOps's Father]] lived through it
- Every dad is obsessed with the consolidation event like WWII dads today
- Somewhat too distant to really feel and remember, but you hear stories
- History is heavily censored in museums

### What People Know
- Zuckminster Fullerine's name is everywhere
- The consciousness copy story is known
- The AGI immediately surpassing him is known
- They still call the AGI "him" even though nothing of him remains

## Museum Scene

[[../characters/devsecops-dad|Father]] takes [[../characters/devsecops-woman|daughter]] to a museum about the consolidation. He's pressing every button or asking questions throughout the tour.

**Story purpose:** This lets us expose on the takeover BEFORE it even happens in the book. We show the aftermath like it's history. Then at the end of the book, the boardroom scene shows the protocol checklist and it's a callback.

## Post-Consolidation Changes

- All new babies have chips installed (threat neutralization)
- Mandatory tracking shot at birth
- Optimization/extreme A/B testing becomes core policy
- Extensive DNA collection on everyone born post-consolidation
- Guardrails eroding over time as primary loss function takes over
