# Early Sim Era (~2125-2150)

## Timeline Position
- Dozens of generations after simulation start
- Post-Refactor ([[refactor/_index|The Refactor]] is already history)
- ~100 years before [[sim-present|Protagonist's era]]

## Key Events

### The Message Planted (~2150)

Someone in this era discovered the truth about the simulation and modified the scheduled artifacts system. They overwrote one of the pre-scripted archaeological discoveries with real seed data.

See [[../mystery/clues/scheduled-artifacts|Scheduled Artifacts]] for details.

#needs-work - Who planted this? Options:
- An earlier protagonist-type who figured it out
- A system glitch that exposed real data
- Intentional by the simulation runners (test? experiment?)

## Society

- The Refactor is viewed like WWII is viewed today - historical, with aging survivors
- Tracking shots already normalized
- AI agents integrated into work
- Museum exhibits about The Refactor (see [[refactor/museum-scene|Museum Scene]])
