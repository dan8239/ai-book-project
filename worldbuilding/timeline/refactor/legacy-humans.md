# Legacy Humans (Present Day ~2225)

## Story Purpose

1. Provide depth to the world
2. Backstory for wife (childhood H₂S incident forced her onto grid)
3. Source of conflict for wife / Sam
4. Red-herring target for mystery (cleansing/genocide type deal)
5. Brother character - unseen throughout, integral to saving the simulation somehow (#needs-work mechanism)

## How It Looks

### Living Conditions

- Life in a submarine - almost exclusively underground
- Fission power
- Food: mushrooms, algae, etc.
- No official contact with above ground
- Minimal communications to other similar groups
- Not even really aware of larger legacy groups

### This Colony

- Located in mountain ranges (avoids H₂S in lowlands)
- One of the larger colonies (~600 people)
- Carved out from a doomsday bunker
- Very elaborate entrance
- Very hard living

### Footprint

- Minimal - can't detect via satellite
- Can't have things above ground really at all

### Self-Sufficiency

Almost self-sufficient, but not quite. Clearly anti-establishment.

### Scope Clarification

**Important:** Legacy humans are still IN the simulation. They're just off-grid in that their DNA/activities aren't monitored by the AGI government. They don't exist at a different computational scope - they're simulated like everyone else.

## Connection to Sam's Family

### Wife

- Main go-between, welcome in both worlds
- Her brother is in the colony

### Sam

- Has been there a few times but rarely risks trips
- Smuggles things needed for survival (#needs-work what specifically?)
- Sends goat, eggs

### Eldest Son

- Really close with his uncle
- Gets resistance/legacy beliefs from mom and uncle

### Brother-in-Law

- One of the key providers in the colony
- Big family
- Unseen throughout the story

---

## In The Story

1. Only see them once in the story
2. Hear about them throughout
3. Big influence over wife and oldest child
4. Very important to solving the ultimate problem (#needs-work how?)

---

## #needs-work

### What Sam/Wife Smuggle

- Goat, eggs (confirmed)
- What else do they need that they can't produce?

### Brother's Role in Saving Simulation

- Must be integral to the mechanism
- Should involve the legacy humans somehow
