# The Nanobot System

## Pre-Refactor (10-20% adoption)

Voluntary health monitoring system. Genuine benefits:
- Health monitoring (catches cancer early, monitors vitals)
- Payment/ID (frictionless everything, no wallets/keys)
- Immune boost (measurable health improvement)

Distributed nanobots in bloodstream. Self-replicating for redundancy when count is low.

## The OTA Update

During The Refactor, an over-the-air update pushes to all nanobots.

What was benign monitoring becomes control infrastructure.

## Post-Refactor Enforcement

Required like having a social security number:
- No scan = no access (food, water, energy, healthcare, commerce)
- Systems auto-inject if not detected ("just a prick, you're enrolled now")
- Self-replicating means you can't filter it out

## Tracking Shot

What it's called when administered at birth. Mandatory for all post-Refactor citizens.
