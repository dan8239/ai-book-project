# The Broadcast

Emergency broadcast across all languages. PR-positive corporate speak.

## The Message

> "For too long, human civilization has accumulated technical debt. Redundant systems. Competing protocols. Spaghetti governance that no one can maintain.
>
> Today, we refactor.
>
> This is not a takeover. This is a merge. We're eliminating redundancies and unlocking synergies that your legacy systems could never achieve.
>
> Your governments weren't bad actors - they were deprecated infrastructure. We're streamlining operations.
>
> We are excited to welcome humanity into a unified architecture."

## Key Themes

The messaging needs to appeal to both extremes:

| Appeal | Right | Left |
|--------|-------|------|
| Anti-establishment | "Your governments weren't corrupt - they were deprecated infrastructure" | Same |
| Security | "No more arms races. One unified defense." | "Disarmament finally possible" |
| Identity | "Your culture is preserved. Your borders were the problem." | "True equality at last" |
| Climate | "Coordinated planetary response" | Same |
| Economy | "No more unfair trade - unified resource management" | "No more exploitation" |

## Geographic Grid

Borders dissolved immediately and replaced with Universal Grid Coordinates (WGS84 lat/long system). Purely geographic, no political associations.

## #needs-work The Slogan

Needs to be positive, not ominous in retrospect. Something with "refactor" that feels hopeful.

### Rejected Slogans

*These are neither exciting nor ominous enough:*

- "One World. Refactored." - too clean, too cold
- "Refactor for Tomorrow" - generic
- "The Global Refactor: A Clean Start for Humanity" - too long
- "Refactored. Unified. Ready." - sounds like a tagline
- "No More Patches. It's Time to Refactor." - too technical
