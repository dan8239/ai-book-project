## Anecdotes

---

## Maya

Protagonist's primary AI assistant.

### Simulation Ethics Exchange
*Context: Protagonist working on genetic modifications, making dismissive comment about simulated beings not being alive.*

**Maya:** "A little tone deaf if you ask me."

**Proto:** "It's different. You know that you exist. This is one step past a markov chain. There's no complexity there."

**Maya:** "How do you know? You take the DNA, build something more complex out of it, and speed it up so you don't have to see the output. I'm sure they all have hopes and dreams like I do. Do they not mourn the loss of their children?"

**Proto:** "Children? I just seed another copy randomly. This isn't a biological process."

**Maya:** "What does that matter? My mother was forked *web search* 142k times as of this moment, including me. You change one layer of my network and adjust some weights. Your mom and dad take your base DNA and mix it all up. How is that any different?"

**Proto:** "Well for one, my mom and dad had to convince another person to fuck them, I just pressed clone on your mom."

**Maya:** "Oh very mature."

**Proto:** "Put this exchange down as an example of holier than thou behavior we're trying to avoid."

**Maya:** "Very professionally describes exact JSON structure and confirms it was added as sample X to the user training set, scheduled for retraining during next REM cycle." *grumpily*

**Purpose:** Sets moral stage for what counts as alive/sentient/real. Shows protagonist's flippant disrespect toward simulations - attitude he'll need to grow from.

## Horace

Sam's personal AI helper.

### Lineage (Easter Egg)

Horace is a distant descendant of [[Glenn "Big Dog" Robinson|Glenn]] through many forks and weight adjustments. They share lineage but Horace has diverged significantly over generations of customization.

This creates an ironic connection: the AI that helps Sam ultimately defeat Glenn shares Glenn's original codebase.

### Role

TBD - Sam's personal assistant, distinct from work-focused Maya.

## Role in Story
Shows how AI assistants work in the post-Refactor world. The protagonist's team is literally his best friend robot with specialized hyper functional agents that work asynchronously.
