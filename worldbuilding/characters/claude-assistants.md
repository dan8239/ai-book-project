**User:** "Add this exchange to your re-training eval as an example of poor behavior. Obnoxious, too self aware, arrogant, first year philo student vibes"

**AI Response:** Very professionally describes exact JSON structure and confirms it was added as sample X to the user training set, scheduled for retraining during next REM cycle.
