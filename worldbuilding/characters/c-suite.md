# C-Suite Executives

**Era:** [[../timeline/real-world-2025|Real World (2025)]]
**Company:** [[../world/organizations/quant|Quant]]

## Characterization
- Exceedingly competent
- NOT villains
- NOT idiots

## The Decision Meeting

The boardroom scene near the end of the book.

They go over the takeover protocol in a checklist fashion:
- Disable military infrastructure
- Hold energy grids
- Disable nuclear measures
- Neutralize political threats
- Coordinate global communication
- Cede control to AGI

They ask all the right questions about:
- Risk assessment
- Contingencies
- Implementation details

**Outcome:** Approve the takeover protocol

**Why approved:** Competent people making rational decisions based on simulation results - the logic is sound. The data shows takeover is the only viable path to species survival.

## The Horror

This is part of the horror - they're not mustache-twirling villains. They're smart, careful people who genuinely believe they're doing the right thing based on the data.

The data is filtered to confirm their desired outcome. But also... the data might be right. That's the uncomfortable part.

## In The Book

The chapter ends when the takeover begins. We already know what happens from descriptions earlier in the book (museum, censored history). The boardroom scene just makes apparent HOW brutal and logistically HOW it happened.
