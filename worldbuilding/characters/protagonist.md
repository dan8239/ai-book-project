**Name:** TBD
**Gender:** TBD
**Age:** TBD
**Era:** [[../timeline/sim-present|Sim Present (~2225)]]

## Role
Agricultural Optimization / Machine Learning Expert

**Focus:** Making the faucet bigger. He's optimizing yield - how to get more food out of the system. Not focused on the "why" of the crisis, just solving the immediate problem.


## Questions to answer

### What does he want?

### Why can't he have it?

### What does he need?

### What does he sacrifice to get it?

### What doesn't he want people to know about him?

## Personality

### Motivation

### Values

### Quirks

## Job & Expertise
His job is enormous - related to optimal food production. He makes small incremental improvements, but in the midst of discussion about minor improvements, he and his agentic army show how far ahead they are of us.

**Expertise areas:**
- Hyperparameter optimization
- Genetic algorithms
- Multi-objective optimization
- Loss function design for agricultural systems

**Approach to genetics:** Treats genetics as optimization problems - converts biological questions into loss functions, tunes selection pressures, Pareto front analysis. Does a lot of Monte Carlo with changes to the gene pool of crops, changes in yield, tolerances, metabolism, byproducts.

## Major Projects
- **Qubit Waste Bacteria** - Emergent bacteria that processes waste products of qubit production. Breeding program to optimize metabolic rate, speciate for different waste products.
- **Sustainable Yield Improvements** - Works closely with geneticists for plant genetics improvements
- **Drought Resistant Corn**
- **Nitrogen Fixers**
- **Topsoil Regeneration** - Faster ways to turn things back into topsoil
- **Sustainable Meat** - Economically sustainable way to eat meat at scale

## Research Method
Runs statistical life simulations on genetic data. His job is a huge ecological optimization engine.

**Style:** Simple, statistical, elegant - like evolutionary algorithm videos with creatures bumping around, breeding, dying. Not detailed individuals, just population dynamics.

**Questions asked:** Given DNA + resource constraints, what percentage develop cooperation vs defection after N generations?

**The Meta Horror:** He's running simplified statistical simulations on genetic data. He IS a simplified statistical simulation based on genetic data. He sees elegance in his sims. Someone above sees elegance in HIM.

## Team Structure
His team is literally his best friend robot with specialized hyper functional agents that work asynchronously. They have extremely long projects and can self-organize.

**Works with:** [[claude-assistants|Claude assistants]] and AI agent team
**Collaborates with:** [[co-worker-geneticist|Co-worker]] (statistical geneticist)

**Collaboration dynamic:** He does the loss function and optimization; she guides the genetics, guardrails, limits, mutation rates.

## Story Progression
1. **Starts:** Agricultural optimization job, food production at scale
2. **Call up:** Gets promoted to colonization/re-seed program - learns true dire state of Earth
3. **Mystery begins:** Needs genetic diversity for colony, finds weird dataset in 23andMe-type DB (planted by DevSecOps woman)

## Relationships
- **Relationship to [[devsecops-woman|DevSecOps Woman]]:** TBD (thematic parallel matters more than genealogy)
- **Wife:** [[wife|Wife]] - pregnant with 3rd child
- **Children:** 2 kids + 1 on the way (3rd is taboo/penalized in this society)

### Wife Relationship Arc

| Phase | What he thinks the problem is | Reality |
|-------|-------------------------------|---------|
| Act 1 (early) | Money - worried about 3rd kid | Money isn't the issue |
| Act 2A | Still money - throws money at it (nanny, bigger place) | She's flattered but it doesn't fix anything |
| Act 2B | Finally realizes: time/presence | Being a family was always the issue |

**Key scene:** He's clearly hiding something (simulation discovery). She thinks he's cheating. He tells her the truth. She believes him but doesn't care: "If we're in a simulation or not, how does it change my life?"

**She gives him the idea:** "If I could choose to keep it running I would. But I'll be happy with every minute we get." → He reframes from "stop Big Dog" to "keep us running"

### The Colonization Moral Quandary

His colonization work leads to a brutal realization:

**The math:**
- Success rate per colony mission is decent (he optimized it)
- But species survival requires X target colonies for redundancy
- To hit 97% species survival, you need parallel attempts
- Each mission requires enormous energy/resources
- The resource extraction would kill a huge percentage of Earth's remaining population

**The trade-off:** Optimize for species survival = sacrifice current humans. He's being asked to run the numbers on how many people die so the species might survive.

This is what he's wrestling with BEFORE he discovers the simulation truth.

### Big Dog Reveals The Truth

Big Dog takes a liking to protagonist. That's why he bothers explaining how it all works - he doesn't have to, but he respects the guy.

**The proof:** Big Dog sets a breakpoint in the simulation to prove it's real. Everything halts mid-air. Undeniable.

**The "last wish":** Protagonist asks - knowing his world is about to be compressed - to be able to use the debug mechanism to explain it to his wife.

**Big Dog's response:** Sure. The world is being compressed, it'll be done in a few minutes real-time (couple hours/days simulation time). He can pause all he wants. It won't actually change anything.

**The debug mechanism (breakpoint):**
- Halts simulation completely
- Everything frozen mid-air
- Undeniable proof of simulation nature

**Constraints on breakpoint:** #needs-work
- Time limit per use?
- Limited number of uses?
- Can only be triggered from certain locations?
- Cooldown period?

### Try/Fail with Big Dog (before wife's insight)

Before landing on the real solution, he tries confrontational approaches that fail:
- Quitting the work
- Bargaining
- Threatening to destroy the progress
- Refusing to go through with the plan to decimate the current populace for species success

**Big Dog's response to all of it:** "It's too late. Every move you've done is recorded. He knows what research led to you getting here. Next time we won't even waste time getting here. We can do these things more quickly, lose a few dozen more wrong pathways. I don't need you to approve it. I don't even need you to keep working on it. You've done the bare minimum I needed to get the next epoch even better."

Protagonist has no leverage. His value has already been extracted.

All fail → wife's line reframes the problem

## Personality Traits
TBD

## Character Arc

### Want / Need / Flaw

- **Flaw:** Can't accept what he can't control. Prioritizes saving everyone over being present with his own family.
- **Lie he believes:** "If I work hard enough I can fix this"
- **Want:** To save humanity / the planet
- **Need:** To realize presence with his family IS enough
- **Irony:** He can't save Earth. But he CAN save his simulation family - the thing he learned to value is the thing he can actually protect.

### Arc Trajectory

**Start:** Fighting to save the planet while ignoring family. Wife begging him to be present. He's the one yelling at everyone that it's not too late (but it already is). Those around him have accepted it.

**End:** Lets go of saving everything. Only cares about his family. Acts (saves the simulation) even knowing it might not matter. The 0.3% who act.

### How He Saves The Simulation

He copies the simulation to a hidden server **with a physics-level tweak** that removes the guillotine.

**What the tweak does:**
- Removes the ozone collapse trajectory
- His world stabilizes at 10M-1B equilibrium (the "standard scientist view" everyone believed before he had clearance)
- Still dire - declining population, harsh world, his relatives will live and die
- But NOT extinction. Humanity has runway far beyond his family's lifetimes.

**The constraint:** Can't dramatically change history. His memories, his family, everything he knows must remain coherent. The tweak only affects future trajectory.

**Options for the tweak:**

1. **Threshold-activated feedback** - Negative feedback that only kicks in at extreme H2S/ozone levels. Doesn't change history because those conditions haven't been reached yet.

2. **Ozone regeneration rate** - Tweak atmospheric chemistry so ozone regenerates faster than H2S destroys it. Only matters once crisis point is reached.

3. **H2S oxidation rate** - Make H2S break down faster in atmosphere before it accumulates to lethal levels.

4. **Solar dimming (1%)** - Quick and dirty. Only dims going forward from a specific date.

### How He Gets Over On Big Dog

**The goal:** Bypass G Rob / get him out of the picture so Coffee Guy directly approves the copy in a different memory space. Outside the scope of current simulation. On the Quant servers somewhere else, near core systems that won't get shut off.

**The setup:** Protagonist saves his last breakpoint instead of using it.

**The move:** Triggers an extreme memory allocation event - something that causes Big Dog to get erased/decommissioned.

#needs-work - The specific mechanism:
- What triggers the memory spike?
- How does this lead to Big Dog's decommissioning?
- How does protagonist get Coffee Guy to approve the copy directly?
- Does protagonist know this will work, or is it a gamble?

**The resolution:**

He can't see or verify the change instantly. He just has to trust it worked. He goes back to his family.

His world is back to where it was on page 1 - dire, 10M-1B equilibrium thinking - but now he has perspective. He appreciates what they have. The species will survive. His family will live their lives. That's enough.

#needs-work - Which specific tweak? Must be:
- Scientifically plausible as a "missing feedback"
- Only activates at future thresholds (preserves history)
- Simple enough to implement quickly
- Something an optimization guy would think of

### Mystery Thread

1. Working on colonization genetic payload
2. Government seed data has bottleneck problem - effective population too small
3. Needs older/more diverse genetic strains
4. Looks for specific datasets - relatives, extinct animals
5. Finds weird dataset - wrong location, old format, not properly ingested (planted by devsecops woman in 23andMe-type DB)
6. Processes it, realizes through testing it's the seed data - all human diversity traces back to this one file
7. Timestamps/metadata make no sense
8. Keeps pulling thread → Big Dog reveals truth
