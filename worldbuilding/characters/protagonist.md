# Protagonist

**Name:** TBD
**Gender:** TBD
**Age:** TBD
**Era:** [[../timeline/sim-present|Sim Present (~2225)]]

## Role

**Not a food scientist**—he's a contractor/builder in [[../world/honeycomb|Honeycomb]].

### How He Works
- Takes **Controller positions** on short contracts (local hex, family unit, etc.)
- Posts **open source projects** that sometimes get funded/forked
- Gets **royalties** when his projects scale
- Still does **human→machine projects**: prototypes solutions that get picked up and maintained by AGI

### How He Made His Money
Built the **M&V (Measurement & Verification) system** that underpins all of Honeycomb's economic measurement:
- Automated energy savings validation
- Canary releases, A/B testing
- Baseline / counterfactual modeling
- Representative sampling
- Out-of-the-box billing

He doesn't have to worry about money but isn't famous in any way—like someone who wrote TCP/IP but isn't a household name.

### Current Contract
**Food chain optimization**—agricultural ML work. This is how he gets called up to the colonization project.

### What Makes Him Rare
Most people just work on AI-originated projects. Sam still originates work that AGI later adopts and maintains. This is increasingly unusual.


## Motivation

e.g. what does the character want?

### What does he want?

### Why can't he have it?

### What does he need?

### What does he sacrifice to get it?

### What doesn't he want people to know about him?

### What in this character's history informs why they do what they do?

Someone close to him died due to an oversight? Or maybe not directly that but adjacent to it. Perhaps father or mother.

### What failure will he never repeat?

Need something here that explains why he is capable of actually solving the problem where all the other simulations didn't.

### How / why is he different from the other 850M simulations? What leap does he take?

He's not special. He's just the first to get there.

### How does he deal with that failure or punish himself?

Blames himself for it. Gallows humor on the surface. Humor as defense mechanism. Humor to not get close to people.

## Personality

How does the character express what they want out of life?

## Values

What are they willing to do or give up to get what they want?

### Quirks

### Flaws

### Limitations

### Hinderances

Morals and family

## CPR

### Competence

Medium to high early, only accelerates as he learns more. How does he become more competent?

### Proactivity

Low to start, gets higher over time

### Relatability

Try to keep this high. Regular guy. Listens to the rules. Trying to help the problem and do his best.

## Job & Expertise
His job is enormous - related to optimal food production. He makes small incremental improvements, but in the midst of discussion about minor improvements, he and his agentic army show how far ahead they are of us.

**Expertise areas:**
- Hyperparameter optimization
- Genetic algorithms
- Multi-objective optimization
- Loss function design for agricultural systems

**Approach to genetics:** Treats genetics as optimization problems - converts biological questions into loss functions, tunes selection pressures, Pareto front analysis. Does a lot of Monte Carlo with changes to the gene pool of crops, changes in yield, tolerances, metabolism, byproducts.

## Major Projects
- **Qubit Waste Bacteria** - Emergent bacteria that processes waste products of qubit production. Breeding program to optimize metabolic rate, speciate for different waste products.
- **Sustainable Yield Improvements** - Works closely with geneticists for plant genetics improvements
- **Drought Resistant Corn**
- **Nitrogen Fixers**
- **Topsoil Regeneration** - Faster ways to turn things back into topsoil
- **Sustainable Meat** - Economically sustainable way to eat meat at scale

## Research Method
Runs statistical life simulations on genetic data. His job is a huge ecological optimization engine.

**Style:** Simple, statistical, elegant - like evolutionary algorithm videos with creatures bumping around, breeding, dying. Not detailed individuals, just population dynamics.

**Questions asked:** Given DNA + resource constraints, what percentage develop cooperation vs defection after N generations?

**The Meta Horror:** He's running simplified statistical simulations on genetic data. He IS a simplified statistical simulation based on genetic data. He sees elegance in his sims. Someone above sees elegance in HIM.

## Team Structure
His team is literally his best friend robot with specialized hyper functional agents that work asynchronously. They have extremely long projects and can self-organize.

**Works with:** [[claude-assistants|Claude assistants]] and AI agent team
**Collaborates with:** [[co-worker-geneticist|Co-worker]] (statistical geneticist)

**Collaboration dynamic:** He does the loss function and optimization; she guides the genetics, guardrails, limits, mutation rates.

## Story Progression
1. **Starts:** Agricultural optimization job, food production at scale
2. **Call up:** Gets promoted to colonization/re-seed program - learns true dire state of Earth
3. **Mystery begins:** Needs genetic diversity for colony, finds weird dataset in 23andMe-type DB (planted by DevSecOps woman)

## Relationships
- **Relationship to [[devsecops-woman|DevSecOps Woman]]:** TBD (thematic parallel matters more than genealogy)
- **Wife:** [[wife|Wife]] - pregnant with 3rd child
- **Children:** 2 kids + 1 on the way (3rd is taboo/penalized in this society)

### Wife Relationship Arc

| Phase | What he thinks the problem is | Reality |
|-------|-------------------------------|---------|
| Act 1 (early) | Money - worried about 3rd kid | Money isn't the issue |
| Act 2A | Still money - throws money at it (nanny, bigger place) | She's flattered but it doesn't fix anything |
| Act 2B | Finally realizes: time/presence | Being a family was always the issue |

**Key scene:** He's clearly hiding something (simulation discovery). She thinks he's cheating. He tells her the truth. She believes him but doesn't care: "If we're in a simulation or not, how does it change my life?"

**She gives him the idea:** "If I could choose to keep it running I would. But I'll be happy with every minute we get." → He reframes from "stop Big Dog" to "keep us running"

### Try/Fail with Big Dog (before wife's insight)

Before landing on the real solution, he tries confrontational approaches that fail:
- Quitting the work
- Bargaining
- Threatening
- All fail → wife's line reframes the problem

## Personality Traits
TBD

## Character Arc

### Want / Need / Flaw

- **Flaw:** Can't accept what he can't control. Prioritizes saving everyone over being present with his own family.
- **Lie he believes:** "If I work hard enough I can fix this"
- **Want:** To save humanity / the planet
- **Need:** To realize presence with his family IS enough
- **Irony:** He can't save Earth. But he CAN save his simulation family - the thing he learned to value is the thing he can actually protect.

### Arc Trajectory

**Start:** Fighting to save the planet while ignoring family. Wife begging him to be present. He's the one yelling at everyone that it's not too late (but it already is). Those around him have accepted it.

**End:** Lets go of saving everything. Only cares about his family. Acts (saves the simulation) even knowing it might not matter. The 0.3% who act.

| 2A  | Ordeal (Midpoint) | Big Dog reveals simulation truth                                     | Existential horror                                              |

| 2B  | Road Back         | Big Dog explains compression coming                                  | All is lost - must find way to save family                      |
| 3   | Resurrection      | Frames Big Dog, copies world to hidden server                        | Acts despite uncertainty                                        |
| 3   | Return            | Goes home, chooses family                                            | Peace with choice, present at last                              |

### Mystery Thread

1. Working on colonization genetic payload
2. Government seed data has bottleneck problem - effective population too small
3. Needs older/more diverse genetic strains
4. Looks for specific datasets - relatives, extinct animals
5. Finds weird dataset - wrong location, old format, not properly ingested (planted by devsecops woman in 23andMe-type DB)
6. Processes it, realizes through testing it's the seed data - all human diversity traces back to this one file
7. Timestamps/metadata make no sense
8. Keeps pulling thread → Big Dog reveals truth
