# Brother-in-Law (Wife's Brother)

**Name:** TBD
**Era:** [[../timeline/sim-present|Sim Present (~2225)]]
**Location:** Legacy human settlement (off-grid)

## Role

Wife's brother. Lives off-grid in a legacy human settlement.

## The Settlement

~600 people. Contends much more directly with the reality of the environmental situation.

## The Secret Support

Protagonist secretly diverts extra energy from his allocation to keep the settlement running.

- Protagonist's whole family is on-grid (he doesn't believe in the legacy lifestyle)
- Wife is on-grid (childhood H₂S incident forced her onto grid for medical care)
- She loves her brother, so protagonist supports them

## The Financial Squeeze

The cost of a 3rd child is equivalent to keeping ~600 underground people alive. Protagonist is squeezed financially, doesn't quite belong in either world.

## The AI Knows

The AI ultimately knows about his secret. They just consider him a net positive - not worth shutting down his ruse because he's still productive for the ultimate goal.

## Role in the Heist

### The Blind Spot Advantage

Legacy humans don't have nanobots. The AGI monitors everyone through nanobot data collection. Outside of those systems = lot of work to detect.

Glenn doesn't bother monitoring legacy humans because the cost isn't worth it. Brother-in-law exists in this blind spot.

### The Blackmail

Sam blackmails him into helping:

> "You will believe me. If you don't do this, I cut you off from X. If you do, I give you Y that removes your dependence on above-ground entirely."

**What Sam threatens:** #needs-work (cut off energy support? something else?)

**What Sam offers:** Something that makes the settlement fully self-sufficient, no longer dependent on Sam's smuggled resources.

### His Crucial Part

#needs-work - Specific role TBD. Must involve:
- Something he can do from the blind spot that Sam can't do while monitored
- Possibly physical presence during the breakpoint (breakpoint only protects those the stopper is touching)
- Timing coordination?
- Data that Sam needs to see?

### In The Story

- Unseen throughout most of the story
- Only appears during the heist sequence
- Big family, key provider in the colony
