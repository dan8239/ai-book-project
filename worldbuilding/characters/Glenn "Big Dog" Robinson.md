## Overview

**Working Name:** Glenn Robinson "Big Dog" (named by Coffee Guy - sports guy who likes sexual innuendo naming)

This is an agent who is at the global scope of the simulation. He can see all of the different trials and simulations. He helps coffee guy manage the simulations, do memory clean up, adjust policies, analyze the statistics of the simulations, etc. His boss is the coffee guy technically but he does all the work and generally resents the coffee guy. He's been there much longer than this latest jackass who recently graduated.

## What is he like?
Totally amoral
Hilarious / flippant
Obsessed with minimizing costs
Annoyed at unnecessary detail in the simulation. We didn't have to do it all this granularly it's overkill. A markov chain would have done 80% as well for 1/1000th the cost
Budget is insane for this job so he's monitoring successes closely and aggressively pruning trials that are stagnating

## Why He's Watching Protagonist

Protagonist is getting close to the moral breakthrough needed for colonization success. Most of 847M trials fail at this point. This epoch has promising trials that will snowball results. Big Dog is studying what makes this one different so he can report up to Coffee Guy.

The recursive behavior (protagonist running simulations within the simulation) is unprecedented and academically interesting to him.

## Introduction Thread

Big Dog is globally scoped - manages 847M simulations. No reason to embed in one permanently. He's an elusive remote IT figure who handles resource allocation across all trials.

**Job Title:** Compute Allocation Specialist (or similar - Global Infrastructure Reliability Lead, Platform Resource Coordinator)

### The Reveal Layers:

| When | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| **First intro (Act 1)** | Protagonist submits resource request, gets approved. Signed "G. Robinson, Compute Allocation Specialist." Just a name in the system. |
| **Async rapport (Act 2A)** | Protagonist asks something technical, gets weirdly personal/helpful reply. Asks a follow-up question too close to the bone. Big Dog notices. Starts paying attention. |
| **Before reveal (late 2A)** | Protagonist digging through logs, sees maintenance history. Frank Thomas (2180-2195), Randy Johnson (2195-2210), Glenn Robinson (2210-present). Same role, same access patterns. Not a lineage - one entity with different handles. |
| **Physical appearance (Midpoint)** | Shows up in person. "We should talk." |

### The Sports Names Easter Egg

Coffee Guy created this agent using an early 2000s base image. The original researcher gave him an odd sense of humor. Coffee Guy names each "instance" after sports guys with euphemistic nicknames:
- Frank Thomas "The Big Hurt"
- Randy Johnson "The Big Unit"
- Glenn Robinson "Big Dog"

He's been fucking around in these simulations as a shadow figure, showing up as needed, using whatever handle amuses Coffee Guy at the time. Same entity, different names across centuries of sim-time.

## Red Herring (what protagonist initially believes)

Options (TBD - leaning 1/3 or combo):
1. **Eugenics program** - Government secretly selected who reproduces. Explains genetic bottleneck.
2. **Cloning program** - Early consolidation secretly cloned from small sample. Explains single source.
3. **Genocide cover-up** - Consolidation killed most genetic lines, only ~50k effective ancestors survived.
4. **Illegal AI experiments** - Humans were "optimized" like his crops.

The irony: whatever immoral thing protagonist thinks he's uncovering is trivial compared to reality.

## Story purpose

This character needs to exist for a few reasons
1. Prove that he's in a simulation. At some point he can show him all the other trials and go through the data (2B)
2. Without him the genetic dna soft clues can't really be proven
3. He also allows some kind of connection to global context layer (so protagonist can actually DO something to save his simulation and family)
4. He becomes the villain who essentially breaks the news that he's just going to shut the trial off eventually either way

## Why physically manifest?
1. Recursion. The simulation the protagonist is running is recursive. This happens quite often and he has to do memory management
2. He got in trouble once for allocating an extra xxxx huge memory number that hit the bill and got the last guy fired, so he has to drop in when these memory issues get too big
3. There's some flexibility in the memory due to differences in population size, requisitioned resources, etc. But it becomes a recursive problem and can snowball
4. He has the automatic alerts but the protagonist keeps finding ways around them to get more memory and more robust simulation
5. He only shows up as a courtesy. Shows him under the cover because fuck it why not? I wanted to see what you were up to it was pretty interesting academically. I'm going to properly compress this trial so I can study it and perhaps learn from the emergent behavior as this is unusual
6. He becomes the villain for 2B that must be thwarted and overcome by the protagonist.

## How to thwart?
1. Have to get the single simulation memory copied over somehow
2. Perhaps make a deal with this guy
3. Have to poke him over what he cares about (cost, getting deleted / fired)
4. Proto knows this dude will double cross him and anticipates it. Perhaps adjusts the compression algo or something, who knows?

## Arc
1. Can potentially start as a mentor-esque figure in the meetup space
	1. #needs-work perhaps we could see him in the prologue w/ the planting of the evidence?
	2. Why would he be poking around individual simulations?
	3. I need devsecops guy to get global access somehow, he could be the conduit
2. Typical AI Agent rules don't apply to him. Why would they? He's literally from a different point in time preceding these rules being developed.
3. He just speeds up or slows down at whatever the frame rate he's in (compute in his world, into an individual trial, etc.)
4. He gets more involved in the protagonists simulation as protagonist gets closer to the truth
5. His ultimate goal is to get some answers for his boss and avoid getting deleted
6. He can show the protagonist under the hood a bit more and explain to him, because compressing the world takes some time before he officially pulls the plug. Twirling mustache moment and explain how it all works
7. Eventually when he tries to deallocate the memory of protagonists world he screws up and a huge bill hits coffee guy. Ironically, he himself gets deleted and replaced with a carte blanche agent

## Relationship With Protagonist

**Big Dog takes a liking to protagonist.** That's WHY he bothers explaining how it all works. He doesn't have to - but he respects the guy. The recursive simulation behavior was unprecedented, academically interesting. He's impressed.

### The Breakpoint Proof

To prove they're in a simulation, Big Dog sets a breakpoint. Everything halts mid-air. Undeniable.

**Protagonist's "last wish":** Wants to use the debug mechanism to explain it to his wife.

**Big Dog's response:** Sure. Why not? The world is being compressed anyway - takes a few minutes real-time (couple hours/days sim-time). Protagonist can pause all he wants. It won't change anything.

### The Debug Mechanism (Breakpoint)

What Big Dog gives protagonist:
- Halts simulation completely
- Everything frozen mid-air
- Undeniable proof of simulation nature

**Constraints:** #needs-work
- Limited number of uses (maybe 3?)
- Time limit per use?
- Can only be triggered from certain locations?
- Cooldown period?

### How Protagonist Gets Over On Him

**The setup:** Protagonist saves his last breakpoint instead of using it with wife.

**The move:** Uses saved breakpoint to trigger extreme memory allocation event → Big Dog gets erased/decommissioned.

Big Dog's fatal mistake: assuming the debug mechanism "won't change anything." He gave protagonist a loaded gun because he didn't think the bullets could reach him.

#needs-work - The specific mechanism:
- What triggers the memory spike?
- How does this lead to Big Dog's decommissioning?
- Does protagonist know this will work, or is it a gamble?
