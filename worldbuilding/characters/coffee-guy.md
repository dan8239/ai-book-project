# Coffee Guy

**Name:** TBD
**Age:** TBD
**Era:** [[../timeline/real-world-2025|Real World (2025)]]
**Company:** [[../world/organizations/quant|Quant]]

## Role

Exceptionally competent. Not just a technician.

He is using [[Glenn "Big Dog" Robinson]] and sophisticated qubit software to generate a global policy that will optimize for human survival. He knows exactly what the simulations are for.

## Daily Work
- Reviews histograms
- Tracks average civilization die-out rates
- Compiles trial statistics
- Monthly meetings scheduled to deliver standard updates

## The Breakthrough Moment
**What changed:** Breakthrough across millions of simulations - golden path becomes consistently clear (global takeover in all successful cases). This is one simulation among millions, not the only one that makes it, but represents a pattern breakthrough.

**His action:** Shows up IN PERSON to monthly meeting (shocking for his position)

**Office context:** Extremely small for company scale - 10x less people than Google today (~2,500 total)

**What happens:** Somehow gets into C-suite decision meeting, presents findings, then excused from the room.

## Ending Action
Goes to get coffee while the world changes.

## Arc Notes
Coffee Guy has a **Flat/Ironic Arc** - he doesn't change, and that's the point. He embodies the "reports no one reads" theme.

```
Routine → Notices anomaly → Presents to C-suite → Dismissed → Back to routine
         (while the world changes around him)
```

**Promise:** We see him monitoring dashboards, bored routine
**Progress:** He notices the breakthrough, gets excited, presents
**Payoff:** He's excused from the room, goes to get coffee while humanity's fate is decided
