# Wife

**Name:** TBD
**Gender:** Woman
**Age:** TBD
**Era:** [[../timeline/sim-present|Sim Present (~2225)]]

## Role
Protagonist's wife. Mother of their children. The thematic heart of the story - embodies the truth protagonist needs to learn.

## Situation
- Pregnant with 3rd child (taboo in this society)
- Beautiful, loving, stressed
- Signaling she needs help (he's missing it)

## What She Wants
- More of the aquarium scene - real world presence
- To raise kids the right way, together
- For him to be HERE, not just providing

She trusts that humans can innovate out of whatever is coming. The purpose is to experience it together.

## Her Philosophy
"This is the only trial we get."

She says this before she knows it's literally true.

**On the crisis:** Boy who cried wolf. How many times did people think it was the end of the world? You do your best and forget the rest. It's bad but it's not her job or role in society.

**On simulation revelation:** "Who cares? If we're in a simulation or we're not, how does it change my life? If god exists or he doesn't, I still have to get my kids to school today and feed them."

## Character Arc

**Arc Type:** Flat Arc - She's right all along. He learns what she already knows.

### The Conflict Progression

| Phase | What protagonist thinks the problem is | What she's actually signaling |
|-------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Early (Act 1) | Money - worried about 3rd kid | Money isn't really the issue |
| Middle (Act 2A) | Still money - throws money at it (nanny, bigger place) | Flattered but it doesn't fix anything |
| Later (Act 2B) | Finally realizes: time/presence | Being a family was always the issue |

### Key Scene: The Reveal

He's clearly lying about something (the simulation discovery). She thinks he's cheating on her. Tension builds until he tells her the truth.

**Her response:** Believes him. Doesn't care.

"If we're in a simulation or we're not, how does it change my life? If he shuts it off will I even notice or will it just end?"

### Gives Him the Idea

"If I could choose to keep it running I would. But I'll be happy with every minute we get."

This somehow plants the seed for his plan to copy the simulation to the hidden server.

*[Refine the exact mechanism later]*

## Economic Context

This world is UBI-based due to AI:
- 1 kid: UBI covers it
- 2 kids: Need an occupation
- 3 kids: Very taboo, heavily penalized financially

His new colonization job relieves the money pressure for kid #3. He thinks this solves the problem. It doesn't.

## Relationship to Protagonist

She's what he's been neglecting while trying to save the world. The irony: he can't save Earth, but he CAN save his family - the thing he learned to value.
