User is writing prose directly. Capture their EXACT words.

DO NOT:
- Convert to bullet points
- Summarize
- Reorganize
- "Clean up"
- Add structure

DO:
- Save exactly what they write
- Preserve their voice, pacing, word choice
- Ask where to save it (which chapter, new file, etc.)
- Commit immediately with their prose

This is their creative writing. Your job is stenographer, not editor.
