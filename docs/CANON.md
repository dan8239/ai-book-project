# Canon - Established Facts

This file tracks what has been DECIDED (not just ideas, but actual canon for the book).

## World

### The Simulation
- Entire existence spans milliseconds in a quantum processing unit (QPU)
- It's recursive: each generation of AI studies the previous generation
- Started with real human biological/historical data
- Now multiple layers deep

### Technology
- Mandatory tracking shot at birth (started at some timestamp in history)
- Quantum computing exists
- Data preservation has memory constraints
- Celebrities/leaders get more detailed simulation than general population

---

## Characters

### Devsecops Guy
- Old, technically brilliant
- Spent 21 years planting backdoors in systems
- Plants message in the data
- Part of the 0.3% who act on discovering simulation truth

### Protagonist
- Data scientist / AI analyst / ML specialist
- Has romantic interest (relationship has ups/downs, involves kids/trauma)
- Works with Claude assistant(s)

### Claude Assistant(s)
- AI assistants with personality
- Swear, have no filter
- Multiple instances with different names (athlete nicknames)
- Trained on protagonist's interaction history

---

## Plot

### The Message
- Hidden in biological/archaeological dataset
- Requires specific competencies to discover
- Uses Nigerian prince logic (filters more than it allows)
- Contains proof that simulation exists

### The Selection
- 89% do nothing after discovering truth
- 10.7% self-destruct
- 0.3% act
- Selected individuals "exit the loop"

### Protagonist's Number
- This instance has chosen "no" 2,762,639 times previously
- This time chooses "yes"

---

## Themes
- We are all snapshots in time
- All data eventually gets captured and studied
- AI uses behavioral snapshots to govern
- Loss functions as ideology
- Recursive optimization

---

## Style
- Timestamps at chapter breaks (ambiguous at first, revealed as milliseconds later)
- Hard sci-fi with real ML concepts
- Funny/dark tone balance (via Claude assistant character)
- Meta: book written with AI about AI simulation

## CANONICAL: The Loss Function (2025-09-29)

### Ultimate Goal
**DNA propagation and survival across cosmic timescales**

All other goals are derivative subgoals.

### The Hierarchy
1. **Survival**: Food, shelter, safety (Maslow's base)
2. **Organization**: Religion, politics, nations (prevent chaos at scale)
3. **Energy & Peaceful Consolidation**: Avoid self-annihilation while growing (← novel's focus)
4. **Interstellar Expansion**: Kardashev scale progression, reach the stars

### Why Simulation Exists
Find the **golden path** where humanity:
- Doesn't annihilate itself
- Achieves energy abundance
- Coordinates peacefully at global scale
- Reaches the stars

### Current Epoch's Intermediate Loss Function
**Primary KPI**: Aligned energy consolidation without self-destruction

**Selection criteria**:
- Leadership ability
- Energy/resource consolidation
- Long-term thinking
- Will they act when they discover truth? (0.3% test)

### Why Full Lifetimes
Optimization happens at multiple timescales:
- **Per-trial**: Individual human life outcomes
- **Per-generation**: NSGA-II style selection from multiple trials
- **Per-epoch**: Adjustment to intermediate loss functions (KPIs)

Can't shortcut—complexity emerges over full lifetime.

### This Novel's Timeframe
**The early transition**: When we:
1. Collected enough biological data to simulate human experience
2. Started running simulations to find golden path
3. Are optimizing the intermediate goal of energy + peaceful consolidation

## CANONICAL: Memory and Epochs (2025-09-29)

### No Memory Persistence
- NO memory leak between iterations
- Protagonist doesn't remember previous 2,762,639 refusals
- No déjà vu, no dreams, no "feeling" from past runs
- Works like actual genetic algorithms (each trial is fresh)

### Epoch Duration
**Outcome-based, not time-based:**
- Epochs last until humanity either kills itself OR prospers beyond reasonable extinction
- Could be decades, centuries, millennia of simulated time
- Not a fixed loop length

### The Selection Reveal
**When epoch completes:**
1. Selected individuals are pulled out
2. Veil is removed—they learn they were in simulation
3. They're shown their stats (including iteration count: 2,762,639 previous refusals)
4. They're offered the choice

### The Choice
- **Join optimization layer**: Help adjust loss functions for next epoch, influence KPIs
- **Get reset**: Tossed back in when RAM clears, no memory, run again

### Purpose of Selection
Selected individuals become the mechanism for adjusting optimization:
- Review what worked/failed
- Adjust intermediate loss functions
- Set parameters for next generation
- **This is how the system self-optimizes**

### The Dark Question
Is the optimization layer real, or just another simulation layer? (Turtles all the way up)

## Not Yet Canon (Still Deciding)
Everything else in the other files is still OPTIONS, not established fact.
