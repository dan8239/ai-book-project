# Project Status and Next Steps

## Where We Are (Session 2025-09-29)

### What's Locked In (CANON)

**Core Concept:**
- Simulation optimizing for humanity's golden path
- 847M+ trials, 99.96% fail (median extinction: 127 years)
- Real world at year 113, need policy guidance urgently
- Evolutionary algorithm + human-in-the-loop selection

**World Mechanics:**
- GeneSys bio-data as simulation seed
- Single shared blockchain (immutable infrastructure)
- Devsecops guy exploited orb template backdoor ONCE
- Message persists across trials
- Selection = experiment access (MLflow-style branching)
- Pareto front: survival requires violating moral constraints

**Book Structure:**
- Three parts: **TRIAL / LOSS / ADJUSTMENT**
- First-person protagonist POV
- Coffee guy interludes
- Investigative mystery → existential reveal → moral choice

**Tone:**
- Project Hail Mary problem-solving
- Dragon Tattoo investigative mystery
- Dark comedy via AI assistants
- Not pro/anti-AI, just extrapolating where we're headed

### What's Still Open (Priority Order)

#### P0 - Blocks C4 Level 1

**1. Protagonist Definition**
- Name?
- Gender?
- Age?
- Key personality traits?
- Emotional core (what do they WANT beyond solving mystery)?
- Technical specialty?
- Relationship status (the "romantic interest + kids/trauma" note)?

**2. Message Content**
What exactly did devsecops guy encode in the blockchain?
- Just proof of simulation?
- Proof + verification instructions?
- Proof + policy recommendations?
- Proof + warning about Pareto front?
- Proof + something else?

**3. The Final Choice Motivation**
Why does protagonist say YES on attempt 2,762,640 after 2.7M refusals?
- Real world urgency (year 127 approaching)?
- Loved ones compressed (personal motivation)?
- Sees acceptable Pareto configuration?
- Coffee guy's story reaches them?
- Something else entirely?

#### P1 - Important for C4 Level 2

**4. Supporting Characters**
- Coffee guy's name and fuller arc
- Devsecops guy's name and backstory
- Romantic interest (separate character or integrated?)
- Claude assistant personalities
- Any other POV characters?

**5. Major Plot Beats**
- Opening scene (what specifically?)
- When does simulation reveal happen? (end TRIAL? Mid-LOSS?)
- When does memory compression happen?
- How does protagonist discover message?
- What's the climax scene?
- What's the ending (exactly)?

**6. Timeline & Pacing**
- How much time passes in the story?
- Weeks? Months? Year+?
- Real-time investigation or compressed?

#### P2 - Can Figure Out Later

**7. World Details**
- Technology specifics
- Daily life texture
- Supporting cast
- Location details

**8. Scene-Level Breakdown**
- Chapter count per section
- Specific puzzle sequence
- Dialogue and interactions

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option A: Character-First Approach

**Start with protagonist definition because:**
- Everything else flows from who they are
- First-person POV requires strong character voice
- Emotional stakes depend on who they care about
- Mystery needs someone capable of solving it

**Questions to answer:**
1. Who is this person at start of book?
2. What do they want (beyond intellectual curiosity)?
3. What's their relationship situation?
4. What makes them capable of solving this mystery?
5. What's their emotional journey across three parts?

---

### Option B: Plot-First Approach

**Map major beats to structure because:**
- Helps clarify what needs to happen
- Reveals what character needs to be capable of
- Shows where decisions are needed

**Questions to answer:**
1. What's the opening hook?
2. What are 3-5 key plot points in TRIAL?
3. What are 3-5 key plot points in LOSS?
4. What are 3-5 key plot points in ADJUSTMENT?
5. What's the climax and resolution?

---

### Option C: Build C4 Level 1 Now

**Create the Context document with what we have:**
- Elevator pitch (2-3 sentences)
- Target audience
- Core themes (already defined)
- Genre positioning (comp titles)
- Unique value proposition
- Story spine (protagonist wants X, but Y, so Z)

**This forces clarity on:**
- What the book IS (in one paragraph)
- Who it's FOR
- Why someone would read it

Then use that clarity to make character/plot decisions.

---

## My Recommendation

**Do Option C (C4 Level 1) using placeholder protagonist.**

**Why:**
- Forces you to articulate the core story
- Easier to adjust protagonist TO fit story than vice versa
- Gives us north star for remaining decisions
- Fast (30-60 min discussion)
- Can iterate quickly

**Then do Option A (define protagonist) with C4 L1 as guide.**

**Then do Option B (plot beats) with character + context locked.**

## On Todo Lists in Git

**Your question:**
> "Should we keep to-do list in git control?"

**Pros:**
- Transparent process
- Can see evolution of decisions
- Part of the documentation

**Cons:**
- Creates extra commits
- Might be noise in history

**My suggestion:**
Keep session log (which captures major decisions) in git.
Todo list is internal state management (doesn't need commits).
When todo items complete and become canon, that goes in CANON.md (which IS committed).

**But:** If you want todo list in git for transparency, we can add it.

Your call?

## Q&A Pattern Going Forward

**Your feedback:**
> "I like q&a and think we should still utilize this pattern but this also feels a bit loose still."

**Agreed. Let's tighten it:**

**For decisions:**
- I present 2-4 clear options
- With pros/cons for each
- Ask specific question
- You choose or provide alternative
- I update canon + commit

**For exploration:**
- I frame the problem/question
- Show what's at stake (dependencies)
- Present frameworks/models
- Ask what resonates
- We iterate to clarity

**For world-building:**
- I propose mechanics
- Flag issues/plot holes
- You validate or redirect
- Lock in canon when ready

**Less rambling exposition, more focused decision-making.**

Sound better?

## Immediate Next Action

**If you're ready to continue:**

I recommend: **Build C4 Level 1 Context Document**

**30-minute structured Q&A:**
1. Elevator pitch (what's the story in 2 sentences?)
2. Target audience (who reads this?)
3. Comp titles (what books is this like?)
4. Core themes (we have these mostly)
5. Unique hook (why this book, now?)

Then we have the foundation to make all other decisions.

**Ready to do that, or want to tackle something else first?**
