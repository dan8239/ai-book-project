# Virtual Meetup Space

#needs-work - needs a better name for this space/technology

The standard way people interact in the simulation world. A realistic metaverse that makes personal interaction possible without physical travel.

## What It Is

- Physical manifestation space accessed via low-fi helmet
- You look exactly like you look in real life (no avatars, no customization)
- Protagonist's attitude: "I'm not into that D&D horseshit" - this is practical, not recreational

## Why It Exists

Transportation is strictly for critical logistics now. More cost-effective to get people together virtually:
- Saves travel expenses
- Saves fuel/energy
- Instant access to anyone, anywhere

## How It Works

### Access
- Low-fi helmet - simple, utilitarian
- Physical manifestation in shared space
- Feels real enough for work, meetings, casual interaction

### Coming and Going
- People noiselessly disappear when they leave (like dropping off a Zoom call)
- No staying for lunch, no bathroom breaks
- Mentally exhausting - you do your collaborative time then isolate

### Personal Work Spaces
After group time, people retreat to their own work environments:
- Mt Everest summit
- Beach
- Whatever space helps you think that day
- This is where the actual work happens

### Work Interface
- Voice activated primarily
- Enormous flexible visual display (graphs, videos, code, frameworks, engineering diagrams)
- Visual exists for abstract thought transfer - externalizing what's in your head
- Most interaction is voice controlled

### Privacy Controls
- Choose who can see you
- Choose who can appear near you
- Some locations are invite-only
- Some locations are public
- No physical violence possible

### Job Market
Open marketplace optimized to match compatible skillsets with work needing to be done. Just let it run and it finds you.

## Story Uses

| Scene | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| **Prologue** | DevSecOps visits museum with her dad (earlier/simpler state of the tech) |
| **Protagonist work** | Where he meets co-workers, collaborates on colonization project |
| **Big Dog interactions** | Async chat becomes face-to-face here when Big Dog finally manifests |
| **Called up to new job** | Gets sucked into colonization program quickly - just shows up |

## AI Agent Markers

AI agents are physically manifested but visually marked. They all wear **beige**.

### Why Beige? (Options - TBD)

| Option | Metaphor | Vibe |
|--------|----------|------|
| **Beige jumpsuit** | Prison uniform - they're labor, not people | Dehumanizing, institutional |
| **Beige collar/band** | Scarlet letter - marked as "other" | Historical shame marker |
| **All-beige clothing** | Servant livery - blend into background | Invisible labor class |
| **Beige skin tone** | Uncanny valley neutral - deliberately "average" | Unsettling sameness |
| **Beige name tag** | Corporate badge for non-employees | Bureaucratic othering |

The marking is normalized - nobody thinks twice about it. But it's a visual caste system.

### Big Dog's Deception
Big Dog pretends to be human - does NOT wear beige. This is part of why protagonist doesn't suspect him initially. The sports names in the logs spanning centuries is the clue, not his appearance.

## Evolution Over Time

| Era | State of the Tech |
|-----|-------------------|
| **Early Sim (~2140)** | DevSecOps era - more rudimentary, museum still impressive |
| **Sim Present (~2225)** | Mature, ubiquitous, taken for granted |
