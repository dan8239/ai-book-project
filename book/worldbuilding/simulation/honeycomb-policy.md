# The Honeycomb Policy

The autonomous governance system that runs the world in Sam's era.

---

## What It Is

A set of **weights and balances** that can adjust policy based on the state of the world. All hyperparameters have been weighted and optimized through millions of simulation trials.

This is the output of [[../characters/coffee-guy|Coffee Guy]]'s life work.

---

## The Loss Function

The policy optimizes for multiple objectives simultaneously:

### Maximize
- **Species survival rate** - Primary objective
- Human flourishing metrics (TBD)

### Minimize
- **Human-on-human violence**
- Resource waste
- Suffering metrics (TBD)

### Constrain
- **Human rights** - Hard constraints that can't be violated
- Individual autonomy thresholds
- Other ethical guardrails (TBD)

**Key insight:** This isn't evil. It's genuinely optimized for good outcomes. The horror is in what "optimal" means at scale, and that 847M simulated humans died to find this path.

## Development Timeline

### Pre-Takeover (Our Near Future)
- Coffee Guy and team run simulations
- 847M+ trials to find the "golden path"
- 99.96% extinction rate in failed trials
- Trial 2,762,640 finally succeeds
- Results presented to C-suite → Takeover approved

### Takeover Day (Prologue)
- T-minus 10 minutes: Final meeting
- Grant Melrose gives the speech
- Systems compromised simultaneously
- Policy goes live

### Human-in-Loop Phase (3 months, not 24)
- Coffee Guy wanted **24 months** to perfect the weights
- He was overruled - they gave him **3 months**
- A/B testing what they already had while "refining"
- Humans still in the loop for major decisions
- Uses UN-style voting system for edge cases
- Rushed over the CTO's objections

### Blue/Green Rollout (4 years)
- Staged release across systems
- President just got re-elected (this meeting is just after other party concedes)
- Policy deployed in stages:
  1. Infrastructure layer
  2. Financial systems
  3. Communications
  4. Government systems
  5. Media distribution
  6. Supply chain
- Full autonomy achieved by end of 4-year term

### The Board (First 30 Years)

**Every person in the war room gets a board seat:**
- Grant Melrose - Chairman (de facto leader, not elected)
- President - Board member (elected official, now subordinate)
- Other executives and officials
- Coffee Guy - lowest ranking, but still gets a seat

This is the transitional governance structure - humans nominally in control.

### Board Dissolution (~30 years post-takeover)

The board is phased out entirely. Replaced by the **driver-controller system** (Honeycomb governance). Human oversight ends. The system runs itself.

### Sam's Era (~2225)
- Policy has been running for ~200 years
- Fully autonomous
- [[glenn-big-dog|Glenn "Big Dog" Robinson]] is the current epoch manager
- The policy IS Honeycomb governance

## Museum Display

At some point Sam sees a chart in a museum showing:
- Timeline of takeover
- Stages of policy deployment
- Grid policy enforcement milestones
- Transition from human-in-loop to full autonomy
- Historical framing (sanitized version of events)

---

## The Irony

The policy was designed to maximize human survival and minimize violence. It succeeded. But:
- It required 847M simulated deaths to find
- Nobody in the C-suite thought about those deaths
- The simulated humans (like Sam) are just data
- The "optimal" path treats consciousness as a variable to optimize

**Sam's horror:** He IS one of those simulation trials. His existence is a test case for a policy that's already been deployed.

---

## Political Ambiguity

**Important:** Never reveal which party is in power. Give equal weighting to left-wing/right-wing signifiers so it remains ambiguous. The point is that this transcends partisan politics - it's about technocratic optimization regardless of ideology.
