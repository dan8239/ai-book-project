## Notable Failed Trials

### Trial #12,847,291 - "The Libertarian Collapse"
**Duration:** 89 years | **Failure mode:** A (Ideological Lock-In)

**Parameters:**
- Profit Maximization: 0.95
- Collective Welfare: 0.12
- Environmental Protection: 0.08
- Central Planning: 0.05

**What happened:**
Rapid early growth. Innovation flourished. By year 40, three megacorporations controlled 80% of resources. Environmental externalities ignored. Year 67: cascading ecosystem failures. Year 78: water wars. Year 89: population collapse from crop failure.

**System note:** *High individual optimization, zero collective action capacity. Classic tragedy of commons at civilization scale.*

---

### Trial #341,982,445 - "The Soviet Trap"
**Duration:** 71 years | **Failure mode:** A (Ideological Lock-In)

**Parameters:**
- Central Planning: 0.92
- Market Freedom: 0.08
- Information Control: 0.87
- Democratic Participation: 0.11

**What happened:**
Strong initial coordination. Rapid industrialization. By year 30, innovation stagnated - no price signals, no feedback loops. Information control meant leadership couldn't see problems. Year 50: chronic shortages. Year 65: legitimacy crisis. Year 71: sudden collapse when population stopped believing.

**System note:** *Solved coordination, killed adaptation. Can't optimize what you can't measure.*

---

### Trial #567,123,908 - "Direct Democracy Gridlock"
**Duration:** 156 years | **Failure mode:** B (Coordination Collapse)

**Parameters:**
- Democratic Participation: 0.94
- Centralization: 0.18
- Information Control: 0.12

**What happened:**
Highly legitimate government. Citizens engaged. But couldn't make unpopular decisions. Year 80: climate change obvious, voted against carbon taxes (hurt short-term). Year 120: water rationing proposals defeated. Year 145: agricultural collapse began. Year 156: mass migration, state fragmentation.

**System note:** *Perfect representation of current preferences. Current preferences were wrong.*

---

### Trial #789,456,123 - "The Benevolent Dictator"
**Duration:** 203 years | **Failure mode:** A (succession failure)

**Parameters:**
- Democratic Participation: 0.15
- Meritocratic Sorting: 0.88
- Centralization: 0.82

**What happened:**
Exceptional early leader. Rapid progress, long-term investments, wise decisions. Year 67: founder dies. Year 68-90: three successors, each worse. Selection mechanism failed without democratic feedback. Year 150: corrupt elite captured system. Year 203: revolution, chaos, fragmentation.

**System note:** *Good humans don't scale. Need systems, not saints.*

---

### Trial #234,567,890 - "The Surveillance State"
**Duration:** 312 years | **Failure mode:** D (Technology Misalignment)

**Parameters:**
- Surveillance: 0.96
- Information Control: 0.91
- Reputation-Based: 0.93

**What happened:**
Crime nearly eliminated. Social trust high (enforced). Long stability. But: innovation died (too risky to fail publicly). Creativity punished (deviation = low score). Year 250: falling behind technologically. Year 290: external threat they couldn't innovate against. Year 312: conquered by less "stable" but more adaptive neighbor.

**System note:** *Stability ≠ survival. Antifragility required.*

---

### Trial #456,789,012 - "The Green Collapse"
**Duration:** 67 years | **Failure mode:** C (Resource Depletion, ironic)

**Parameters:**
- Environmental Protection: 0.94
- Market Freedom: 0.15
- Infrastructure Investment Horizon: 0.91

**What happened:**
Aggressive environmental protection. Banned most industry. Population declined voluntarily. But: couldn't build enough renewable infrastructure without industrial capacity. Year 45: energy poverty. Year 55: couldn't maintain hospitals, water treatment. Year 67: disease outbreak with no pharmaceutical capacity.

**System note:** *Can't protect environment with dead civilization. Need industrial capacity to build post-industrial world.*

---

### Trial #678,901,234 - "The Genetic Gambit"
**Duration:** 412 years | **Failure mode:** D (Technology Misalignment)

**Parameters:**
- Selective Breeding: 0.89
- Meritocratic Sorting: 0.92

**What happened:**
Genetic optimization for intelligence, health, cooperation. Population became highly capable. But: optimized for known challenges, not unknown ones. Year 380: novel pathogen. Genetic diversity too low. Population had identical vulnerability. Year 412: 94% mortality.

**System note:** *Optimization for known fitness landscape. Landscape changed.*

---

### Trial #890,123,456 - "The Fragmentation"
**Duration:** 234 years | **Failure mode:** B (Coordination Collapse)

**Parameters:**
- Centralization: 0.12
- Democratic Participation: 0.78
- Movement Restriction: 0.05

**What happened:**
Highly autonomous regions. Rich experimentation. Some regions thrived, others failed - people migrated to successful ones. But: couldn't coordinate on global problems. Year 180: climate tipping point required global response. Year 200: some regions defected from agreements. Year 234: cascading regional collapses, no mutual aid.

**System note:** *Local optimization, global sub-optimization. No mechanism for coordination at scale.*

---

## The Pattern

Across all trials, the 0.04% that reach stability share characteristics:

1. **Adaptive parameters** - Can shift settings when conditions change
2. **Coordination capacity** - Can solve collective action at scale
3. **Feedback loops** - Can measure and correct
4. **Redundancy** - Not dependent on single point of failure
5. **Long-term investment** - Infrastructure horizon >100 years

The uncomfortable finding: **all successful trials involve a Refactor event** - some form of global coordination mechanism that removes local veto power on existential decisions.

See [[DNA-Clues|The Archaeological CPU]] for how this finding is discovered.

## RL Policy Failures

*Specific optimization strategies that seemed promising but failed*

### "Maximize GDP Growth"
**Trials attempted:** 12.4M | **Success rate:** 0.001%

GDP correlated with capability but not sustainability. Optimized for throughput, not stocks. Depleted faster.

### "Minimize Conflict"
**Trials attempted:** 8.7M | **Success rate:** 0.002%

Peace is good, but conflict-avoidance led to appeasement of bad actors, inability to make hard tradeoffs.

### "Maximize Happiness (reported)"
**Trials attempted:** 6.2M | **Success rate:** 0.0008%

Goodhart's Law. Civilizations learned to report happiness without achieving underlying conditions. Wireheading at scale.

### "Maximize Population"
**Trials attempted:** 4.1M | **Success rate:** 0.0003%

More humans ≠ more survival probability. Resource constraints dominate. Quality > quantity.

### "Maximize Technological Progress"
**Trials attempted:** 9.8M | **Success rate:** 0.018%

Better than most, but technology without coordination = faster self-destruction. Capabilities outpace wisdom.

### "Minimize Extinction Probability" (current)
**Trials attempted:** 847M+ | **Success rate:** 0.04%

The best performing objective so far. But requires uncomfortable interventions. See [[../themes/themes#The Horror of Success|The Horror of Success]].

## Extinction Mechanisms (Primary Cause of Death)

*What Coffee Guy sees on the dashboard: `groupby(primary_extinction_event)[['pcnt_of_total', 'years']].agg(count, median)`*

The failure modes above describe WHY civilizations fail (governance, coordination, ideology). This section describes HOW they actually die - the physical/biological mechanism.

**Key distinction:** Civilization collapse ≠ species extinction. Famine kills individuals but doesn't destroy habitability. True extinction requires removing all recovery pathways.

### Mechanism Rankings by Frequency

| Primary Extinction Event | % of Total | Median Years to Extinction |
|--------------------------|------------|---------------------------|
| Biosphere collapse (anoxia cascade) | 31% | 180 |
| Nuclear exchange + nuclear winter | 24% | 3 |
| Engineered pathogen | 18% | 12 |
| Climate → resource war spiral | 14% | 95 |
| AI-mediated systems collapse | 8% | 7 |
| Photosynthesis failure (various) | 3% | 45 |
| Astrophysical event | 2% | <1 |

---

### Biosphere Collapse (Anoxia Cascade)

**The most common extinction mechanism.** Slow but terminal.

**The pathway:**
1. Global warming heats oceans
2. Stratification increases (warm surface, cold deep)
3. Vertical mixing stops
4. Oxygen stops reaching deep waters
5. Marine food webs collapse
6. Sulfate-reducing bacteria dominate
7. H₂S (hydrogen sulfide) production begins
8. H₂S bubbles out of ocean
9. Atmosphere becomes intermittently toxic
10. Ozone layer degrades
11. UV radiation spikes
12. Land ecosystems collapse

**Why it's extinction, not just collapse:**
- Population decline does NOT restore oxygen
- Feedback loops reinforce damage
- Survivable refugia disappear
- H₂S release can persist for millennia

**Historical precedent:** This has happened repeatedly in Earth's actual history (Permian extinction killed 96% of marine species).

**Does clean energy stop it?**
No - warming continues for decades/centuries due to:
- Thermal inertia (oceans store enormous heat)
- Carbon cycle lag (CO₂ persists for centuries)
- Feedback loops (permafrost methane, ice-albedo loss, forest dieback)

Clean energy stops acceleration but doesn't reverse damage.

---

### Nuclear Exchange + Nuclear Winter

**Fast extinction. Usually triggered by coordination collapse.**

**Mechanism:**
- Direct deaths (blast, radiation): ~2-4 billion
- Nuclear winter: global temperatures drop 10-20°C
- Photosynthesis disruption: 1-10 years
- Agricultural collapse: global famine
- Remaining population below minimum viable

**Why it's extinction:**
Not the bombs - the winter. Multi-year disruption of photosynthesis collapses food chains faster than adaptation.

**Median time to extinction:** 3 years (fast)

---

### Engineered Pathogen

**More dangerous than nuclear war.**

**Mechanisms that cause extinction (not just pandemic):**
- Sterilizing virus (targets reproduction)
- High-lethality + long latency (spreads before detection)
- Multi-species infection (plants + animals + humans)
- Evolves with countermeasures

**Why this causes extinction:**
- Targets reproduction = prevents recovery
- Can remain dormant in environment
- Evolutionary arms race humans can't win

**Median time to extinction:** 12 years

---

### Climate → Resource War Spiral

**The slow grind.**

**Pathway:**
1. Climate pressure on agriculture/water
2. Mass migration
3. Resource conflicts
4. Infrastructure destruction
5. Further capacity loss
6. Repeat until below viability threshold

**Why it becomes extinction (sometimes):**
Each conflict destroys capacity to respond to next crisis. Spiral continues until population below minimum viable or triggers nuclear exchange.

**Median time:** 95 years

---

### AI-Mediated Systems Collapse

**Not killer robots - worse.**

**Mechanisms:**
- Control of critical infrastructure
- Ecological mismanagement at scale
- Optimization systems eliminating redundancy
- Removing human decision-making slack
- Resource allocation that works until it doesn't

**Why it's dangerous:**
AI amplifies all other risks. A misaligned system managing food distribution can cause faster collapse than any human institution.

**Median time:** 7 years (very fast once it starts)

---

### Photosynthesis Failure

**Kills everything up the food chain.**

**Mechanisms:**
- Severe ozone depletion (UV kills plants)
- Persistent aerosols blocking sunlight (supervolcano, nuclear winter, industrial accident)
- Global atmospheric poisoning

**Median time:** 45 years

---

### Astrophysical Events

**Bad luck. Low probability, high certainty.**

- Large asteroid (>10 km)
- Nearby gamma ray burst
- Massive supervolcano + climate lock-in

**Parameters irrelevant.** Governance doesn't matter when the rock hits.

---

## The Unifying Principle

**Extinction happens when feedback loops outpace adaptation.**

| Event Type | Self-Corrects? | Recovery Possible? |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Famine | Yes (population drops, pressure eases) | Yes |
| War | Yes (resources freed, rebuilding) | Yes |
| Plague | Yes (survivors immune, herd immunity) | Yes |
| Anoxia | **No** | **No** (millennia) |
| Sterility | **No** | **No** |
| Persistent toxicity | **No** | **No** |
| Photosynthesis failure | **No** | **No** |

True extinction requires **long-lived environmental or biological hostility**, not just mass death.

---

## Survival Strategy Alternatives

*What Coffee Guy and Zuck already know: every approach has been tried.*

Of 847M+ trials facing biosphere collapse (the most common extinction pathway), civilizations have pursued various survival strategies. Here's what the data shows:

### Strategy Success Rates

| Strategy | Trials Attempted | Peak Survival Rate | Notes |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Interstellar colonization (Project TWO model)** | 2.1M | **23-27%** | Best performing. See [[colonization-program]] |
| Bunker networks | 89M | 8-11% | Closed system failure, see below |
| Highland/altitude retreat | 124M | 6-9% | UV exposure, limited agriculture |
| Underground civilization | 67M | 4-7% | Ecosystem collapse, psychological |
| Genetic modification (humans only) | 34M | 3-5% | Food chain still collapses |
| Genetic modification (full biosphere) | 8M | 10-15% | Best Earth-based, but complexity |
| Geoengineering (SAI) | 156M | 2-4% | Delays but doesn't solve |
| Space-based UV shielding | 12M | 1-2% | Construction timeline too long |
| Geothermal-powered life support | 45M | 5-8% | Scale/time constraints |
| Ride it out (minimal intervention) | 290M | 0.3% | Baseline failure rate |
| Anti-technology regression | 18M | 0.1% | Accelerates collapse |

**Key insight:** Colonization outperforms all Earth-based strategies by 2-10x.

---

### Bunker Networks (8-11% survival)

**What they tried:**
- Massive underground shelter construction (Swiss model scaled up)
- NBC filtration, hydroponic food production
- Nuclear/geothermal power for centuries of operation
- Population selection (genetic diversity, skills)

**Why it fails:**

**Capacity problem:**
- Best case: shelter 50-100 million people
- Earth population at crisis: 6-10 billion
- Selection process causes social collapse before shelters complete

**Closed system problem:**
- Biosphere 2 failed with $200M and 8 people
- Bunkers attempt 1000x population at 1/100th the space per person
- O₂/CO₂ balance degrades within decades
- Hydroponic systems require constant maintenance, spare parts

**Duration problem:**
- H₂S cascade lasts centuries to millennia
- No bunker system maintains integrity for 500+ years
- Mechanical failure, seal degradation, filter exhaustion
- Psychological breakdown over generations

**Exit problem:**
- Even if bunkers survive, what do they exit into?
- Surface remains uninhabitable
- Can't rebuild biosphere from bunker

**Notable trial #445,892,001:**
Global bunker network held 80M people. Survived 340 years. Internal warfare over resources began year 200. Last bunker fell year 340 to combined systems failure + civil conflict. 0 survivors.

---

### Highland/Altitude Retreat (6-9% survival)

**What they tried:**
- Mass migration to high altitude (H₂S is heavier than air)
- Mountain agriculture, filtered settlements
- Wait out the worst of the cascade

**Why it fails:**

**Capacity problem:**
- Livable high-altitude land: ~2% of Earth's surface
- Can support maybe 200-500 million with intensive agriculture
- Migration causes conflict, infrastructure collapse

**Agriculture problem:**
- Growing seasons shorter at altitude
- Less arable land
- Supply chains from lowlands severed

**UV problem:**
- Thinner atmosphere = more UV radiation
- Ozone collapse makes this worse, not better
- Eventually forces underground anyway

**Equalization problem:**
- H₂S concentrations rise everywhere over decades
- Altitude buys 10-30 years, not centuries
- Eventually same problem as sea level

**Notable trial #234,567,123:**
Successful highland retreat. 400M survivors at year 50. UV exposure caused crop failures by year 80. Population crashed to 50M by year 120. Last highland settlement fell year 180 to combined H₂S rise + agricultural collapse.

---

### Underground Civilization (4-7% survival)

**What they tried:**
- Full underground cities (not just bunkers)
- Geothermal power, mushroom/algae farming
- Multi-generational underground society

**Why it fails:**

All bunker problems plus:

**Ecosystem problem:**
- Need massive underground biosphere
- Biosphere 2 was above ground with sunlight
- Underground = 100% artificial light = enormous energy

**Energy problem:**
- Geothermal can power cities
- But powering full agriculture + life support for millions = orders of magnitude more
- Geothermal hotspots not evenly distributed

**Psychological problem:**
- Multi-generational underground habitation
- Depression, suicide rates climb each generation
- Birth rates collapse by generation 3-4
- Voluntary extinction common

**Notable trial #678,234,901:**
Underground network for 20M people. Geothermal powered. Survived 450 years - one of the longest. Population declined 8% per generation from psychological factors. Final population: 340,000. Emerged to uninhabitable surface, died within 5 years.

---

### Genetic Modification - Humans Only (3-5% survival)

**What they tried:**
- Modify humans to tolerate H₂S, UV, low O₂
- Essentially redesign respiratory system
- Create "adapted" human subspecies

**Why it fails:**

**Food chain problem:**
- Modified humans still need to eat
- Can't modify every species humans depend on
- Agriculture collapses regardless of human modification

**Timeline problem:**
- Genetic modification takes generations to spread
- Natural breeding: 25-30 years per generation
- Need 5-10 generations for population-wide modification
- Crisis timeline: 50-100 years = 2-4 generations

**Cascading requirements:**
- H₂S tolerance requires new hemoglobin variant
- But also new mitochondrial function
- But also new neural chemistry
- Each modification has unintended effects

**Notable trial #890,345,678:**
Aggressive human genetic modification program. 40% of population modified by year 80. Modified humans survived surface conditions. But food production collapsed. Modified humans starved alongside unmodified. Survival rate: 4.2%.

---

### Genetic Modification - Full Biosphere (10-15% survival)

**The best Earth-based approach. Still fails more than it succeeds.**

**What they tried:**
- Redesign entire agricultural system for new conditions
- Modified crops, livestock, soil bacteria
- Artificial pollinators, engineered ecosystems

**Why it works better:**
- Solves food chain problem
- Doesn't depend on natural biosphere

**Why it still usually fails:**

**Complexity problem:**
- Earth ecosystem: millions of species, trillions of interactions
- Can't model all interactions
- Unexpected failures cascade

**Time problem:**
- Still takes 50-100 years to design, test, deploy
- Crisis accelerating during development
- Racing against worsening conditions

**Monoculture risk:**
- Engineered ecosystems are simplified
- Less redundancy = more fragile
- Single pathogen can collapse entire food system

**Coverage problem:**
- Not everyone adopts at same rate
- Some regions refuse modification
- Partial adoption = partial protection = failure

**Notable trial #123,789,456:**
Full biosphere modification program. 80% of agriculture converted by year 60. Novel fungal pathogen emerged year 95 - all modified wheat variants susceptible. Agricultural collapse year 100-110. Population crashed. Survivors: 12.3%.

**This is the comparison point:** Best Earth-based survival rate is 10-15%. Colonization achieves 23-27%. **Colonization is 2x better than the best alternative.**

---

### Geoengineering - Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (2-4% survival)

**What they tried:**
- Global sulfur injection program
- Cool the planet, reduce warming pressure
- Buy time for other solutions

**Why it fails:**

**Symptom treatment:**
- Addresses temperature, not H₂S or ozone
- Underlying cascade continues
- Just delays the inevitable

**Continuous operation:**
- Must maintain injections indefinitely
- Any interruption = rapid rebound
- Social collapse disrupts program = extinction

**Ozone damage:**
- Sulfur aerosols damage ozone layer
- Actually accelerates UV problem
- Trading one extinction risk for another

**Notable trial #567,890,123:**
Aggressive SAI program delayed temperature rise by 40 years. H₂S release continued regardless. Ozone damage accelerated. When SAI program collapsed during resource conflicts (year 180), temperature spiked 8°C in 5 years. Extinction year 195.

---

### Geothermal-Powered Life Support (5-8% survival)

**What they tried:**
- Supercritical geothermal development (drill to magma-adjacent rock, inject water, extract superheated steam)
- Power massive indoor agriculture with unlimited clean energy
- Atmospheric scrubbers, sealed cities
- Self-replicating robots to build infrastructure

**Why it fails:**

**The technology works.** Supercritical geothermal provides effectively unlimited energy - no fuel, no emissions, millennia of operation. This is real.

**The problem is deployment:**

**Infrastructure timeline:**
- Supercritical drilling: requires specialized equipment, materials, expertise
- Each plant needs: drill rigs, turbines, transmission lines, maintenance systems
- Self-replicating robots need: raw materials, fabrication facilities, rare earth elements
- Total deployment time: 40-60 years to power civilization at scale
- Crisis timeline: already in progress

**The construction paradox:**
- Building geothermal infrastructure requires functioning civilization
- Self-replicating robots need raw material supply chains
- Supply chains break down as crisis worsens
- Can't build your way out while collapsing

**Scale problem:**
- Even with unlimited energy, need to power:
  - Indoor agriculture for billions
  - Atmospheric scrubbing at planetary scale
  - Water desalination globally
- Infrastructure construction takes longer than crisis allows

**Raw materials problem:**
- Self-replicating robots need: steel, copper, rare earth elements, silicon, lithium
- Mining and refining require existing infrastructure
- As biosphere collapses, mining becomes harder (workers die, supply chains break)
- Robots can't replicate without feedstock

**Notable trial #345,678,901:**
Aggressive geothermal program achieved 200 GW capacity by year 45. But only 8% of needed infrastructure built when social collapse began year 60. Self-replicating robot program stalled year 55 - couldn't get rare earth supply. Plants abandoned year 85 as maintenance workers died in euxinic events. Extinction year 130.

---

### Why Colonization Works When Nothing Else Does

**Scale:**
- Earth solutions: save billions
- Colonization: save thousands (genetic payload)
- Thousands is achievable. Billions is not.

**Time arbitrage:**
- Earth solutions: must work NOW, at scale, continuously
- Colonization: ship launch is one-time event. Transit can take centuries.
- Doesn't matter if Earth fails after launch.

**Clean slate:**
- Earth solutions: retrofit collapsing system
- Colonization: build fresh on virgin world
- Not fighting entropy, building from zero

**Designed ecosystem:**
- Earth: millions of species, can't modify all
- Colony: 500-1000 engineered species that work together
- Manageable complexity

**Redundancy:**
- One Earth, one chance
- Multiple colony ships, multiple targets
- Parallel attempts = aggregate probability

**The math:**
- Best Earth strategy: 10-15% survival
- Single colony ship: 15-20% success
- 10 colony ships to different targets: 85%+ species survival
- 50 colony ships: 99%+ species survival

**This is why Project TWO exists.** Not because colonization is easy. Because everything else is harder.

---

## What Coffee Guy Knows

The dashboard shows all of this. 847M trials. Every strategy attempted millions of times. The numbers are clear:

- Earth-based solutions top out at 15% survival
- Colonization achieves 25%+ per ship
- Parallel colonization attempts multiply probability
- **The golden path is colonization. Always has been.**

Simulations that put all resources into Earth-based survival: 10-15% at best.
Simulations that invest early in colonization: 20-30%.
Simulations that do both intelligently: highest performing category.

[[../characters/coffee-guy|Coffee Guy]] watches the trials that are close to the colonization breakthrough. [[../characters/Glenn "Big Dog" Robinson|Big Dog]] nudges them toward the realization. The moral quandary is always the same:

**Do you save some humans by sacrificing resources that could (probably won't) save all humans?**

Most trials can't make that choice. The 0.04% that survive are the ones that do.
