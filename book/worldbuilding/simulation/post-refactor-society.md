# Post-Refactor Society

## Governance
[[../timeline/the-refactor|The Refactor]] already happened. Origin/before-times not clearly recalled.

**Key tone:** This is NOT a dystopian post-apocalyptic hellhole. It's a pre-apocalyptic, technologically advanced civilization that is having its usable land and energy/food sources stripped away slowly. Life goes on. The horror is in the trajectory, not the present.

## Infrastructure

### Power Grid
- Government is electric-based, requires stable grid
- Grid is functional and maintained
- Energy is rationed but available
- Renewable infrastructure widespread
- The problem isn't blackouts - it's that energy goes to essentials first

### Technology Level
- **Space travel:** Exists. Colonization program is real, active, funded.
- **Robotics:** Advanced. Protagonist's team is AI agents. Autonomous systems everywhere.
- **Computing:** Quantum computing exists. Simulations run on massive infrastructure.
- **Medicine:** Advanced but rationed. Gene therapy, life extension for some.
- **Agriculture:** High-tech vertical farms, engineered crops, precision optimization.

The tech is there. The problem is resource constraints on what it can do.

## Core Policies
- **Mandatory tracking shot at birth**
- **Optimization/extreme A/B testing** is core policy approach
- **Extensive DNA collection** on everyone born post-Refactor

## Why This Funding Exists
Post-Refactor government obsessed with biological/species survival R&D:
- Nursery pod program needs this research
- Understanding survival traits
- Population optimization
- Planetary colonization planning

This is why [[Sam|Protagonist]] is deep in DNA data (where [[../characters/devsecops-woman|DevSecOps]] hid message).

## Geography
Idaho desert area, arid climate, resource constraints visible.

## Work Culture
- The only company that matters is organized with human-in-the-loop AI teams
- Really small and productive teams
- AI agents work autonomously on long projects
- Both [[Sam|Sam]] and [[../characters/co-worker-geneticist|co-worker]] are hyper exceptional at their job but basically run a small staff that are all autonomous (all AI agents)

## News & Media
TBD - how does news work in this world?

## Climate State (~2225, +6°C above pre-industrial)

### What's Gone
- **Ice:** Arctic ice-free year-round, Greenland largely gone, West Antarctic collapsed
- **Sea level:** +3-5m already, 15-25m committed over centuries
- **Coral reefs:** Completely dead
- **Fish stocks:** 90%+ collapsed
- **Biodiversity:** 50-70% of species extinct, megafauna gone outside reserves

### Geography Transformed
- **Deserts:** Sahara expanded south, Mediterranean basin desert, American Southwest uninhabitable
- **Equatorial zone:** Largely depopulated (wet-bulb temps exceed survivability)
- **Population centers:** Shifted to Canada, Siberia, Scandinavia, Patagonia
- **Coastlines:** Major cities relocated, walled, or abandoned

### Daily Reality

Life is normal. That's the unsettling part.

| Aspect | What It's Like |
|--------|----------------|
| Weather | Extreme events are normal - seasonal hurricanes, floods, droughts. People adapt. |
| Seasons | Barely recognizable - "winter" is mild, "summer" is dangerous. But AC exists. |
| Sky | Hazy - aerosols, particulates, occasional sulfur smell near coasts |
| Nature | Parks are museums - "wilderness" is managed, not wild |
| Work | People have jobs. Offices exist. Meetings happen. Deadlines. |
| Entertainment | Media, games, sports, art. Culture continues. |
| Travel | Restricted but possible. Virtual presence more common. |

People complain about their commute, argue about politics, fall in love, raise kids. The slow squeeze is background noise to daily life.

### Food System

UBI provided. Food is what can survive in these conditions. Much less meat. The food pyramid is based on FCR (Food Conversion Ratio - calories in ÷ calories out). Less stable but optimized around efficiency.

**Why no cows/pigs:** FCR is terrible (6-10 for beef, 3-4 for pork). Can't justify the calorie math.

**What's left in the oceans:** Anoxic, +10°C hotter water kills most fish. Squid survive in pockets. Jellyfish actually thrive in low-oxygen dead zones (bloom today in polluted waters). Neither is efficient food.

#### Food Pyramid by Tier

**S-Tier (Staples):**
| Food | FCR | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|
| Yeast / SCP | 0.6–0.9 | Doesn't compete with human-edible calories |
| Black soldier fly larvae | 0.8–1.0 | Indoor, survives everything |
| Earthworms | 0.9–1.1 | Indoor, survives everything |
| Microalgae | 0.5–0.8 | Struggles with H₂S/UV but viable |
| Seaweed (kelp) | 0.4–0.7 | Ocean issues but still grows in some areas |
| Potatoes | 0.08–0.12 | Heat-tolerant varieties engineered |
| Cassava / yams | 0.10–0.14 | Tropical staple that survives |
| Sweet potatoes | 0.12–0.18 | Same |
| Rice (paddy) | 0.15–0.20 | Where water allows |
| Wheat | 0.18–0.25 | Limited growing zones now |
| Maize (corn) | 0.20–0.28 | Weather chaos vulnerability |
| Legumes | 0.22–0.35 | Essential protein |

**A-Tier (Available):**
| Food | FCR | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|
| Mealworms / grubs | 1.3–1.7 | Indoor protein |
| Duck (rice-integrated) | 2.2–3.0 | Works with paddy systems |
| Duck eggs | ~2.5 | Same |
| Goat milk | 3.5–5.0 | Doesn't need human-edible feed |
| Buffalo milk | 3.0–4.0 | Same |
| Goat (meat) | 4–6 | Marginal but available |

**B-Tier (Luxury):**
| Food | FCR | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|
| Squid | 1.2–1.5 | Ocean pockets only, H₂S issues |
| Low-trophic fish | 1.1–1.5 | Very limited |
| Chicken (broiler) | 1.6–2.0 | Indoor bred, competes for grain |
| Eggs (grain-fed) | ~2.2 | Same |

**C-Tier (Rare/Elite):**
| Food | FCR | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|
| Pork | 3–4 | Inefficient, grain competition |
| Sheep / lamb | 5–8 | Almost never |
| Beef (industrial) | 6–10 | Essentially extinct as food |

**D-Tier (Desperation):**
| Food | FCR | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|
| Jellyfish | ~1.0 | Survives anoxic oceans, terrible nutrition |

### Energy

All-electric infrastructure. Each home is dual metered:

| Meter | What It Covers | Cost |
|-------|----------------|------|
| **Life Support** | Government-provided, covers 1000 sqft per family | Free (part of UBI) |
| **Submeter** | Anything beyond life support allocation | Fairly expensive |

- Grid is stable - government runs on it, can't afford blackouts
- Renewables widespread, nuclear where possible
- Fossil fuels heavily restricted (accelerates the problem)
- You can use as much as you want if you can pay for it
- Most people can't pay for much beyond the life support allocation

### Birth Control
- **1 child:** UBI covers it
- **2 children:** Need an occupation
- **3 children:** Taboo, heavily penalized financially
- **Forced sterilization:** Becoming more prevalent in some regions

### The Tension
World is *stable* - they've adapted. But protagonist knows from his food work:
- Caloric output flat, population still growing slowly
- One bad harvest from crisis
- Genetic base too narrow
- Ocean data getting worse every year
- **It's not "if" - it's "when"**

Everyone else has accepted this. He's still fighting it.

## The Anoxia Threat

The real danger that drives colonization urgency.

### What Is Anoxia?

Ocean anoxia = oxygen disappears from deep water. When this happens at scale, sulfate-reducing bacteria take over and produce H₂S (hydrogen sulfide).

### What Is H₂S?

Hydrogen sulfide. The rotten egg smell - "like chicken eggs," not that anyone's seen one in decades. **It kills by blocking how cells use oxygen.**

**Scientific terms:**
- **Euxinia** - the condition of anoxic, sulfidic oceans (from "Euxine Sea," ancient name for the Black Sea)
- **Euxinic events** - what they call the toxic releases
- "The oceans are going euxinic" - the phrase everyone dreads

**Mechanism:** H₂S binds to cytochrome c oxidase - the enzyme in mitochondria that lets cells use oxygen. Same kill mechanism as cyanide. Your cells suffocate even if oxygen is present.

**Toxicity levels:**
- 10-50 ppm: Eye irritation, coughing
- 100 ppm: Lose your sense of smell (can't detect it anymore)
- 500+ ppm: Unconscious in minutes, dead shortly after

**The danger:** Once oceans go anoxic, H₂S builds up in deep water, then bubbles out into atmosphere. Coastal areas become intermittently lethal. Then it spreads.

**Secondary effect:** H₂S breaks down ozone layer → UV radiation spikes → plants die from radiation too.

This is not theoretical. It happened during the Permian extinction (96% of marine species died).

### Timeline and Progression

| Phase | Timeframe | Symptoms |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Early warning** | Decades before | Deep ocean oxygen levels dropping, dead zones expanding from coasts |
| **Acceleration** | Years 0-50 | Stratification locks in, vertical mixing stops, marine food webs collapsing |
| **H₂S production** | Years 30-100 | Sulfur bacteria dominate anoxic zones, first H₂S blooms in isolated basins |
| **Atmospheric release** | Years 80-200 | H₂S bubbles out of ocean, coastal die-offs, intermittent toxic air events |
| **Ozone degradation** | Years 100-300 | H₂S breaks down ozone, UV radiation spikes, land plants stressed |
| **Biosphere collapse** | Years 200-500+ | Cascading extinction, persistent toxicity, recovery impossible for millennia |

**Current state in protagonist's era:** Phase 2-3 transition (~50-80 year mark). Population declining. Trajectory is clear. Not total war - nothing to fight over. The enemy is the air itself.

### Euxinic Event Progression (What It Looks Like)

**Phase 1: "Incidents" (Years 0-20)**
- Mass fish kills, whale strandings, seabird colonies wiped out
- Isolated "toxic fog" blamed on industrial accidents
- Sporadic deaths - fishermen, coastal workers
- Coastal property values collapse

**Phase 2: "Seasonal Events" (Years 20-50)**
- Predictable toxic seasons on certain coasts
- Storms concentrate H₂S and carry it 50-100km inland ("sulfide storms")
- Permanent evacuation of some coastlines, seasonal evacuations elsewhere
- "Euxinic forecasts" like weather reports
- Agriculture fails near coasts first

**Phase 3: "Permanent Zones" (Years 50-80) ← PROTAGONIST'S ERA**
- Entire coastlines permanently toxic
- Events push further inland each year
- H₂S pools in valleys, basements, low areas (heavier than air)
- Interior highlands become population centers
- Population down to 2-3 billion and falling
- Bodies found in ditches, underground areas

**Phase 4: "Collapse" (Years 80-120)**
- Safe zones shrinking
- Events overlap - no recovery time
- Ozone degradation means UV kills what H₂S doesn't
- Population below 1 billion, sealed habitats only
- **Species extinction within a generation**

### How Quickly It Kills

**Animals:**
- Low concentration: Eyes burn, coughing, retreat and survive
- Moderate: Smell disappears (olfactory paralysis at ~100ppm) - THIS IS THE DANGER SIGN
- High: One breath, unconscious, dead in minutes

**The horror:** When you stop smelling rotten eggs, you're dying.

**Plants:**
| Exposure | Timeline | Effect |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Low chronic | Weeks-months | Stunted growth, yellowing |
| Moderate event | Hours-days | Leaf damage, wilting, partial die-off |
| High concentration | Hours | Rapid tissue death |
| Repeated events | Cumulative | Soil goes sulfidic, ecosystem collapse |

After a sulfide storm passes: animals dead within minutes, plants show damage within hours, die-off over days. You survive the event, then watch your crops die over the next week.

### #needs-work Scene: Family Member Saved From Event
*Add scene somewhere earlier showing what an event is like - someone gets caught, pulled to safety, describes the experience. The smell disappearing. The confusion. Near-death.*

### Why Genetic Modification Can't Save Them

This is the key question: if they can engineer humans for other planets, why not engineer Earth life to survive?

**The core problem:** H₂S blocks the same cellular machinery in ALL aerobic life. Plants, animals, fungi, bacteria - everything that uses oxygen to make energy uses the same cytochrome c oxidase enzyme that H₂S poisons.

**Can't you engineer H₂S-resistant plants?**

Plants photosynthesize (make oxygen), but they also respire (use oxygen). Their mitochondria work the same way ours do. To make them resistant, you'd need to:
- Redesign the electron transport chain (fundamental biochemistry, not a gene tweak)
- Do it for ALL plants, not just food crops
- Also all pollinators (or crops don't reproduce)
- Also all soil bacteria (or soil dies)
- Also all decomposers (or nutrients don't cycle)
- Rebuild the entire ecosystem from scratch

That's not genetic modification. That's redesigning life itself. And you'd need to do it for millions of species simultaneously while the existing biosphere collapses around you.

**Also:** H₂S breaks down ozone → UV radiation spikes → even "resistant" plants would need to survive radiation levels that sterilize surfaces.

**Colonization is different because:**
- You're starting fresh with a functional (or newly-built) biosphere
- You're not fighting a poisoned, collapsing system
- You can engineer a FEW species for a new environment, not save an entire dying ecosystem

**The horrible truth:** Earth is a write-off. You can't fix it. You can only leave.

### What Protagonist Knows

From his food optimization work, he sees:
- Ocean oxygen data trending down
- Models showing tipping point in 50-150 years
- No intervention that reverses the trajectory
- **The colonization program isn't about expansion - it's about escape**

This is why everyone else has "accepted it." There's nothing to do except:
1. Leave (colonization)
2. Wait to die (everyone else)
3. Fight anyway (protagonist's flaw)
