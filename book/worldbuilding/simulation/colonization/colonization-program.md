# Project Te Waka Ora

**Alias:** Project TWO (double meaning - the second try of human civilization)

The space colonization effort. Not expansion - escape.

Named for the Polynesian voyagers who colonized the Pacific islands, carrying portable ecosystems in their canoes - taro, pigs, chickens, dogs. They didn't just move people; they moved entire biospheres.

## Why Colonization Exists

See [[extinction-trajectory#The Guillotine (Classified Knowledge)|The Guillotine]] for full context.

**The public story:** Mars colonization has already happened. It's just a science experiment out there. A few thousand moles living underground scraping microbes off of the tunnel walls. How could they pull from the food chain division for that?
**The classified truth:** Earth is a write-off. Ozone collapse is coming. Colonization is the only path where humans survive at all. Mars needs insane terraforming. Thousands of years. Not nearly enough time or carrying capacity. It's still dependent on imports from Earth. Mars is dead too.

## The Program

### What They're Doing

Mass nursery pods with robotic civilization starter kits sent to viable planets:
- Self-replicating systems
- Low individual success rate but high aggregate probability
- Genetic payload optimized for each target world

### The Math (Moral Quandary)

- Success rate per colony mission is decent (protagonist optimized it)
- But species survival requires X target colonies for redundancy
- To hit six sigma species survival, you need parallel attempts
- Each mission requires enormous energy/resources
- **The resource extraction would kill a huge percentage of Earth's remaining population**

Trade-off: Optimize for species survival = sacrifice current humans. [[../characters/protagonist|Protagonist]] is asked to run the numbers on how many people die so the species might survive.

## Protagonist's Job

From [[../characters/protagonist#Story Progression|Protagonist Story Progression]]:

1. **Starts:** Agricultural optimization job, food production at scale
2. **Call up:** Gets promoted to colonization/re-seed program - learns true dire state of Earth
3. **Mystery begins:** Needs genetic diversity for colony, finds weird dataset

### The Work

Selecting gene pairings for every shuttle going to new colonies. Optimizing for:
- Survival of each colony
- Failure rates of shuttles
- Weight of shuttle
- Budget constraints
- Effective genetic diversity
- Conditions of target planets
- Success rate of different landing zones

### Tools & Access

- Insane simulation data via AI assistant (MCPs)
- Mission data
- Planetary data
- **World DNA bank** (key to solving mystery later)

Linear optimization + Monte Carlo + space travel physics + genetic modification parameters.

Protagonist doesn't know shit about space - AI handles it. He's the optimization guy making the faucet bigger.

## Starglass Technology

Pioneered in Mars orbit. Makes detection of Earth-like planets (small, rocky, orbiting yellow dwarfs) much easier.

**The streetlight effect:** Asked why, on a dark night, he was looking for his missing car keys beneath a street lamp, the man answered, "because the light's better."

We found plenty of planets under the street lamp because red dwarfs let you see the planets around them. Now we can actually search beyond the street lamp.

**Before Starglass:** Most discovered exoplanets orbited dim red dwarfs. Hundreds of "Earth-like" planets found, but:
- So close to their dim stars they're tidally locked
- Blasted sterile by radiation
- Not viable

**After Starglass:** Previously unknown exoplanets discoverable at huge scale. This is the pretext for finding 2-3 new stars that are much more Earth-like (though still not perfect for reasons TBD).

## Civboat Pattern

**Working titles:** civboat, lifeboat, civseed, bloomer

Self-replicating civilization starter ships. The pattern:

1. Launch civboat toward initial targets (2-3 stars)
2. During journey, uses new perspective + starglass to continuously discover new planets
3. Forks and redirects routes (very minimal turning radius, but still many stars to check)
4. Process repeats up to X times

**Open:** Raw material collection mechanism TBD.

### Approach & Landing Sequence

**In transit:** Replicates and forks.

**Approach phase:** As it gets closer to target planet, scans and refines understanding of:
- Atmosphere makeup
- Density
- Likely regions and makeup of resources

**Recon phase:** First payload goes down as probe/recon:
- Scans everything
- Finds resource deposits compatible with landing
- Sends data up to orbiting payload

**Landing:** Once landing area determined, main payload comes down in location most compatible with survival.

---

## Protagonist's Contribution

**The original ask:** Optimize survival for 2-3 specific planets. Niche problem.

**What he finds:**
- He can raise survival rates on those specific planets much higher
- But most failure cases aren't at the destination - they're in transit, landing, or planet viability uncertainty (outside tolerable pressures, etc.)
- Optimizing for 3 perfect missions misses the point

**The multi-part insight:**

1. **Resource allocation:** Quantity > Quality, especially on same vectors (similar paths). 30 "good enough" missions beats 3 "perfect" ones.

2. **Generalized payload:** Start with generic payload with extreme genetic variation instead of planet-specific optimization. Onboard sequencer samples and generates fertilized eggs with custom sequences during transit.

3. **Don't waste the ship:** Key realization - don't discard navigation/ship once you arrive. There are more planets on that vector. Duplicate entire payload and keep going in that direction.

**Why him:** His food chain optimization background - he's used to thinking about yield across uncertain conditions, redundancy, and resource allocation. The space specialists were optimizing the wrong thing.

### The Moral Cost

**Original approach (Mars terraforming):** Change the planet to fit humans. Long and hard. Planets take forever to change.

**His realization:** Biology doesn't. Biology is flexible.

**Government policy:** "Humans and their descendants survive." That's the constraint. Not "humans as we know them."

**What he builds:** Seed payload with flora, fauna, humans. But by the time it's morphed into something that survives the target planet, it's hardly recognizable. Descended from us, selected from our ecosystem, but post-human.

**The question:** Is humanity "saved" if what survives isn't recognizably human?

**His journey:** Learns the constraints as he gets deeper. Originally meant to solve for the perfect planet. Realizes scale + flexibility of constraints solves the problem. He solves it, but the morality is murky.

## Propulsion

**Diffraction sail.** No ground-based laser infrastructure required.

**Flight pattern:**
1. Accelerate using origin star's light
2. Store energy in transit via solar cells
3. Decelerate using destination star's light
4. Repeat for next star

## Civboat Architecture

Von Neumann self-replicating craft. Components:

| Section | Function |
|---------|----------|
| **Probe** | Instruments + goal-directed AI to guide the construct |
| **Life-support** | Mechanisms to repair and maintain the construct |
| **Factory** | Harvest resources, replicate itself |
| **Memory banks** | Store programs for all components + information gained |
| **Engine** | Propulsion (diffraction sail) |
| **Payload** | Genetic payload with land-bound version of same architecture |

**Recursive structure:** The payload contains a land-bound self-replicator. Self-replicator inside a self-replicator. (Theme: nesting/recursion)

## The Technology

### Golden Path Solution

From [[optimization-mechanics|Optimization Mechanics]]:

- Nursery pods with robotic civilization starter kits
- Self-replicating systems
- Low individual success but high aggregate probability
- Automated policy enforcement
- Genetic seeding for other planets

### Why This Approach

**Can't you just fix Earth?**

See [[post-refactor-society#Why Genetic Modification Can't Save Them|Why Genetic Modification Can't Save Them]]

- H₂S blocks cellular machinery in ALL aerobic life
- Would need to redesign electron transport chain (fundamental biochemistry)
- Would need to do it for ALL species simultaneously
- Can't rebuild entire ecosystem while it's collapsing

**Colonization is different because:**
- Starting fresh with newly-built biosphere
- Not fighting a poisoned, collapsing system
- Can engineer FEW species for new environment

## Timeline

| Phase | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| **Protagonist's era** | Active program, shuttles launching, genetic payloads being optimized |
| **Discovery** | Protagonist needs more genetic diversity, finds weird dataset in 23andMe-type DB |
| **Moral choice** | Must make callous decision for colonization (TBD - morph DNA beyond recognition?) |
| **Technical solution** | Technically solves colonization optimization |
| **The horror** | Learns epoch is ending, world will be erased - his work doesn't matter |

## Connection to Mystery

1. Working on colonization genetic payload
2. Government seed data has bottleneck problem - effective population too small
3. Needs older/more diverse genetic strains
4. Looks for specific datasets - relatives, extinct variants
5. Finds weird dataset - wrong location, old format, not properly ingested
6. This is where [[../characters/devsecops-woman|DevSecOps woman]] planted the message

## What Big Dog Is Watching

From [[../characters/Glenn "Big Dog" Robinson#Why He's Watching Protagonist|Big Dog]]:

Protagonist is getting close to the moral breakthrough needed for colonization success. Most of 847M trials fail at this point. This epoch has promising trials that will snowball results.

## Open Questions

#needs-work
- What specific moral choice is required for colonization?
- How many colonies needed for 97% species survival?
- What percentage of Earth population dies for the resource extraction?
- What does "morph DNA beyond recognition" mean specifically?
- Which planets make the final target list?
- What's the travel time to each at realistic propulsion tech?
