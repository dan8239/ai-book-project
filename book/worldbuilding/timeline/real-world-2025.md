# Real World (2025)

Coffee Guy's era. Pre-takeover.

**Characters:** [[../characters/coffee-guy|Coffee Guy]], [[../characters/c-suite|C-Suite Executives]]
**Company:** [[../world/organizations/quant|Quant]]

## What's Happening

Quant is running simulations to SHAPE the AGI's policy before the takeover.

**The purpose of simulations:**
- Not just "save the species" as simple directive
- Mathematical policy shaped by RL
- Run fake worlds → keep survivors → repeat → extract policy
- They need justification/confidence before pulling the trigger

**What they've found:**
- Takeover is the only viable path
- All other scenarios have even lower success rates (0.04% WITH takeover)
- Protagonist's simulation = first somewhat repeatable timeline that shows a path forward

## Coffee Guy's Role

Exceptionally competent. Not just a technician.

He is using [[../characters/Glenn "Big Dog" Robinson|Glenn Robinson (Big Dog)]] and sophisticated qubit software to generate a global policy that will optimize for human survival.

## Resource Pressures

Severe pressure on:
- Food
- Water
- Energy

The euxinic events have begun (Phase 1-2). The trajectory is clear. This is WHY the takeover is being prepared.

## Data Source

23andMe-style genetic data - enough to bootstrap realistic populations for the simulations.

## Technical Details

- Qubits already exist (not invented by AGI later)
- Simulations are extremely memory intensive
- Limited by physical memory constraints - less detailed than reality
- Time compression: Entire simulation runs in milliseconds QPU time
