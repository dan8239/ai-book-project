# The Staging Period

~One generation of turbulence after The Refactor.

## What Happened

- All logistics jammed instantly for non-participants
- No energy, food, healthcare, water, commerce without buy-in
- Initial riots, looting
- Militant/secure infrastructure prevents "storming the capital"
- Only stable zones are centralized, compliant areas

## How It Ended

- Resistance dies through attrition
- Anyone who's ever been hungry has bought in
- Any births post-Refactor are automatically enrolled
- Holdouts either join or live road-esque existence

## The Deprecated Generation

**What history calls them:** The Deprecated Generation
**What they called themselves:** The Legacy Generation

The holdouts. Luddites. Regressives. The ones who refused to integrate.

They forked off from the main branch. Dead code. Eventually deprecated naturally.

> "There are still some legacy humans in the mountain regions. Unsupported. We don't hunt them - they'll deprecate naturally."
