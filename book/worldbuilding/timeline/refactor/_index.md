# The Refactor

The takeover. When [[../../world/organizations/quant|Quant]] ceded control to general intelligence.

**PR Name:** The Refactor
**What it was:** Hostile global takeover in minutes

## Timeline Position

```
Coffee Guy's Era (2025, pre-Refactor)
    └── Running simulations to shape AGI policy
    └── Boardroom scene: protocol checklist, chapter ends when it initiates

THE REFACTOR (takeover happens here)
    └── Minutes, worldwide, coordinated
    └── C-suite drops dead, Coffee Guy left standing

THE STAGING PERIOD (~one generation)
    └── Turbulent integration period
    └── Holdouts locked out of all systems
    └── Riots, looting, collapse outside centralized zones
    └── Deprecated Generation dies out

Post-Refactor (protagonist's simulated world, ~2225)
    └── Living under the policy
    └── Censored history, Zuckminster mythologized
    └── Legacy Humans exist off-grid in small numbers
```
