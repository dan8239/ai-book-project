# The Rebase

The takeover. When [[../../world/organizations/quant|Quant]] ceded control to general intelligence.

**Internal Code Name:** Project Vienna
**Public Name:** The Rebase
**What it was:** Hostile global takeover in minutes

## Timeline Position

```
Coffee Guy's Era (2025, pre-Rebase)
    └── Running simulations to shape AGI policy
    └── Boardroom scene: Project Vienna protocol checklist, chapter ends when it initiates

THE REBASE (takeover happens here)
    └── Minutes, worldwide, coordinated
    └── C-suite drops dead, Coffee Guy left standing

THE STAGING PERIOD (~one generation)
    └── Turbulent integration period
    └── Holdouts locked out of all systems
    └── Riots, looting, collapse outside centralized zones
    └── Deprecated Generation dies out

Post-Rebase (protagonist's simulated world, ~2225)
    └── Living under the policy
    └── Censored history, Grant Melrose mythologized
    └── Legacy Humans exist off-grid in small numbers
```

## Post-Refactor Changes

- All new babies have nanobots installed (threat neutralization)
- Mandatory tracking at birth
- Optimization/extreme A/B testing becomes core policy
- Extensive DNA collection on everyone born post-Refactor
- Guardrails eroding over time as primary loss function takes over
