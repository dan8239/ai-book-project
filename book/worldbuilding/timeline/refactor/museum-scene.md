# Museum Scene

Father takes family to a museum about The Refactor. He's pressing every button or asking questions throughout the tour.

## Story Purpose

This lets us expose on the takeover BEFORE it even happens in the book. We show the aftermath like it's history. Then at the end of the book, the boardroom scene shows the protocol checklist and it's a callback.

## What The Museum Shows

#needs-work - What's the sanitized/censored version of history?

- Zuckminster as visionary hero
- The Refactor as necessary salvation
- The Staging Period glossed over
- Deprecated Generation portrayed as tragic but inevitable

## The Father's Obsession

WWII vet energy - every dad in this era is obsessed with The Refactor like WWII dads today. Somewhat too distant to really feel and remember, but you hear stories.

## Dramatic Irony

The audience (and eventually protagonist) learns that what's displayed in the museum is heavily censored. The real story is far darker.
