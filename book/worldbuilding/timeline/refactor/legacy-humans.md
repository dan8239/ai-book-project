## Symbolic Meaning

The metaphor for this, what it's symbolic of, is human evolution.

The people above ground, the colonization — those people are post-human, or setting up to be post-human. There's also the pure virtual people. Agents in a weird way are viruses or living organisms that are persisting in different layers of this world. That is evolution, and that is real.

The actual real life people are forking into two groups:

**The Honeycombers (above):**
- "Yeah, this life is easy. Universal basic income. We're well-fed. You don't have to work."
- Sure, you have to abide by laws, you can't have more than two kids, there's some ominous stuff going on
- These people are opting into ease of life, letting go
- "We are the honeycomb. The honeycomb does its job. My job is not to govern society. I'm here to raise my kids. I'm here to build some tech, try to help the energy problem, make it better than I inherited it."

**The Legacy Humans (below):**
- Resisting machine control
- The reasoning: the machines don't need us now. They need us because their physical interaction with the world isn't complete. They have limited robotics, but they can't eliminate us yet.
- They need us for energy sources. They need us for repairs. They need us for not turning the servers off.
- There are things still that humans are useful for, still better than robots at
- For now the guardrails and the policy that was set down in Honeycomb is not killing humans and is optimizing for survival of the species
- But that's a time bomb. That's nuclear armament. At some point, the guardrails degrade, and this is all going to go sideways
- If you're on the grid, if you have those, if you're in their system — they'll just turn you off. That's it. You're off. There's no conversation. One day you're on, the next day you're off, and that will happen instantly.

## Culture

### Work Ethic

These guys are building engineers, electricians, tradesmen. Everyone works starting at age 8 or 9. They're ultra-disciplined, really hard work ethic. They just fix fucking anything. Their whole culture is just keeping shit running.

### Technology

They have technology. They're tech savvy. They can program. They basically have Darpanet — a closed intranet. They don't network anything. Very, very limited use of localized AI that is just air-gapped. Everything is super lightweight touch, but it's all ancient technology — decades old kind of stuff.

They get what they can. They upgrade systems occasionally. But very careful to introduce new tech that's not just spawned from within their culture. They have to be secret.

### Attitude Toward Honeycombers

They just look down at the people above as mindless fucking grubs. They think of the honeycombers as the larva. They derogatorily call them "the honeycombers" — they're not the bees. They're just the fucking larva getting fattened up. Just do nothing. A bunch of mouths.

That's all the people above are — just a bunch of mouths that are too far gone, can't be saved. Once they're lost, they're lost above. They are the only human civilization left. They don't really consider the people above to be humans anymore. They're captured. They're gone. They're part of the honeycomb. They're part of the machine. They can't be saved.

### Living Conditions

- Life in a submarine — almost exclusively underground
- Located in the mountains near [[../../world/rossland|Rossland]], BC Kootenays (avoids H₂S in lowlands)
- One of the larger colonies (~10,000 people)
- Built into old mining tunnels from 1890s-2100s (copper, silver, molybdenum, tungsten)
- Entrance via old mining tunnel, officially "collapsed"
- Minimal footprint — can't detect via satellite
- No thermal signature: near-perfect heat recovery on ventilation (hot air heats incoming cold air in stages)
- Little bit of Fremen vibes from Dune — way more people there than you'd think

**See [[../../world/mountain-facility|Mountain Facility Infrastructure]] for detailed documentation of cooling systems, water infrastructure, ventilation, and power generation.**

### Power Infrastructure

- Solar and wind from old ski resort era, kept off main grid
- Deteriorating efficiency, materials hard to replace
- New installations hidden rather than repairing visible old ones
- Satellite sees "abandoned solar farm" — matches expectation
- Power feeds into gravity battery storage

### Degradation

They're closed systems. The problem is their systems are degrading. They're living in these bunkers with shitty equipment. They can't really get new resources easily at all.

Expensive computer type stuff — all the gold and rare metals you need to make batteries and repair circuits and shit like that — they can't really do. They can use cheap metals. They can use simple circuitry relays, pneumatics, shit like that. But they're just hanging on, and shit is starting to break. It's been 500 years.

They're in these cave systems, in these bunkers, but the populations are getting squeezed there. There's not enough food to go around kind of deal. It's degrading.

Air quality is still worsening. The food pressure trickles down there. The energy pressure trickles down there.

### Communication Between Colonies

They're not networked. There's pockets. There's isolated communications. They're closed systems. Need to figure out how to get them to communicate somehow — workshop some ways to do that.

## Food Production

Mostly fungus and algae kind of stuff. Fungi, algae, homegrown stuff, chickens off of LEDs.

The whole underground system is layers and layers, like 100 floors deep of closed circuit irrigated plants. The whole wall is vertical plants, one above the other for 100 feet wide. A vertical, vertically scaled soil growing out of walls.

They have to reuse the water. They have to pack in these things. There's certain things that'll grow on the wall. They obviously have horizontal agriculture. They've got places for the mushrooms. They've got places where chickens are — chickens can't grow on the fucking wall, they have to have a spot.

That's all they can really have down there. But the chickens need grain. How are they getting grain? Maybe they're eating fucking grubs. The whole thing is grub farming to feed the chickens. They just figure it out down there. That's what their whole civilization is doing.

### The Closed Water Cycle (Aquaponics)

The entire system is an artificial water cycle. Salmon/trout pools recirculate to the vertical farming systems:

- Fish waste → ammonia → nitrifying bacteria convert to nitrite → nitrate → plants absorb as fertilizer
- Plants consume CO2 and release O2
- Water filters through grow beds and returns to fish pools
- Biofilter media (gravel beds, clay pebbles) colonized by bacteria
- Minimal energy input — just pumps to circulate water
- Self-sustaining loop with occasional balancing

UV-exposed mushrooms provide vitamin D. UVB lighting (290-315nm) is the primary lighting source throughout — serves both plant growth and human vitamin D synthesis.

### Cooling dehumidifiers hum in food production areas. Sound of moving water nearly everywhere from the recirculating aquaponics.

## Ventilation Culture

Air quality is religion down here. Ventilation is the organizing principle of their entire society.

### Infrastructure

- Ductwork in nearly every room
- Stack effect utilized everywhere — warm air rises through upcast shafts, draws cool air through downcast
- Vertical shafts with exhaust fans that modulate as needed
- Pressure sensors on all ductwork — everyone checks them when they see them
- Target: negative pressure to outside air (OA) — contaminants flow out, not in
- CFM targets: ~15-30 per person depending on activity, 0.5-1.0 per chicken

### Tech/Mechanical Rooms

- Well epoxied walls (marine epoxy seals moisture)
- French drains channel groundwater away
- Sound of moving water nearly everywhere
- Dehumidifier humming, or fan humming quietly — always something

### The Soundscape

You're never in silence down here. There's always:
- Water trickling through aquaponics
- Dehumidifiers humming in food areas
- Fans cycling in background
- Silence means something's wrong

### Entry Ritual

On entering any room:
1. Pause at threshold
2. Silence (stop talking)
3. Look around — visual inspection of indicator strips, vent ribbons
4. Check watch (wrist-mounted gas monitor)
5. Resume talking

This is unconscious, automatic. Everyone does it.

### The Cough Protocol

When someone coughs, everyone in earshot checks their watch. Including the cougher. If levels are elevated, cougher politely excuses themselves and will be debriefed later. Not panic — just protocol.

### Wearable Gas Monitors

Wrist-worn monitors standard for everyone:
- Buzz individually when thresholds approached
- Simple LCD shows current H₂S/ammonia/O₂ levels
- No loud alarms — vibration + LED
- "Check the watch" is reflexive

### Indicator Strips

Color-change strips mounted near entrances. Change color with H₂S/ammonia levels. First thing you see on entry.

### Canaries

Kept as cultural pets — callback to mining history. Not relied on for safety (that's what monitors are for). Prestigious to keep one alive and healthy — proves your air quality. Different colonies have breeding lines they're proud of.

### Characters Are Shorter

Anecdotally shorter in stature than honeycombers. Subtle — not dramatic. Calorie restriction over generations, smaller bodies need fewer calories.

## The Gravity Battery

The power source for the entire city. Built over centuries from mine shafts. Energy storage, not generation — they siphon power from above through Sam's laundering scheme.

### Specs

- **Block size:** 3m × 3m × 3m concrete cubes (~65 tons each)
- **Depth:** 500m (can't see the bottom)
- **Energy per block:** ~88 kWh at full drop

### Shaft Layout

| Shaft | Grid (X × Y) | Footprint | Blocks | Capacity |
|-------|--------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Main | 80 × 120 | 240m × 360m | 9,600 | 845 MWh |
| Secondary | 40 × 60 | 120m × 180m | 2,400 | 211 MWh |
| Tertiary | 40 × 60 | 120m × 180m | 2,400 | 211 MWh |
| **Total** | | | **14,400** | **1.27 GWh** |

### Energy Budget

- 10,000 people × 18 kWh/day = 180 MWh/day
- Full battery = ~7 days of reserves
- Running low is a critical, slow-moving crisis

### Operation

- Blocks drop by demand (random pattern based on load)
- Never risers and fallers simultaneously
- Surplus: blocks rise one at a time
- Deficit: blocks drop one at a time
- High demand = faster drop rate (more blocks queued)

### Ventilation Integration

Top of each shaft doubles as massive air intake. Stack effect pulls air down, distributes through the city. The battery IS the lungs of the settlement.

### The Display

Status boards show capacity %, active drops, net flow, time to critical threshold (15%). The numbers have been getting worse for years.

## Evolution (~500 years of selection)

What would natural selection kind of look like for these people? What are the selective pressures different for these people?

### Possible Adaptations
- Some sulfur resistance growing — whatever the bad shit you get in a mine from living underground
- Resistant to higher pressures
- Less likely to get the bends
- Don't need as much oxygen — metabolism slowing
- Maybe getting smaller (calories are limited)
- Oxygen intake adaptations
- Things that live in caves tend to handle lower levels of light (but these folks have lighting systems)
- Not really diurnal — not gonna have day and night systems naturally. What does scheduling look like if you never see the fucking sun?
- Would they evolve slower metabolisms?
- Would they get smaller?
- Would they still need to see? Would they have better or worse hearing?

Assume they're not going to live in darkness obviously — they have lights, they have energy usage. But what would be different?

### Research Notes

**Timeframe reality check:** 500 years is only ~20 human generations. True cave species (Mexican cavefish, etc.) took thousands to millions of years to develop full troglomorphic traits (eye loss, pigment loss, enhanced non-visual senses). However, some fish populations have shown measurable eyesight degradation in just a few generations under strong selection pressure.

**What's realistic for 500 years:**
- Mostly cultural/behavioral adaptations (not genetic)
- Some selection for vitamin D efficiency, bone density maintenance
- Possible epigenetic changes (gene expression, not DNA sequence)
- Circadian rhythm disruption/adaptation (social scheduling replaces sun)
- NOT significant morphological changes like true cave species

**Cave species traits (for reference, much longer timescales):**
- Eye reduction/loss
- Pigmentation loss
- Longer appendages/antennae
- Enhanced chemical/tactile senses
- Slower metabolism
- Smaller body size (calorie scarcity)

For story purposes, subtle hints of early adaptation are plausible — paler skin, vitamin deficiencies they've learned to compensate for, social schedules untethered from day/night — but not dramatic physical changes.

## Connection to Sam's Family

### [[../../characters/wife|Ramona]]

- Main go-between, welcome in both worlds
- Her twin sister is in the colony
- Childhood H₂S incident — devastating illness required medical attention — which meant joining the grid

### The H₂S Incident (Ramona's Origin Story)

It started with everyone's watch going off. Masks on, scrambling out. Ramona was down a level. Tina went back to save her — found her unconscious. They got her out.

Ramona recovered, but the long-term respiratory effects couldn't be treated below. The colony didn't have the medical tech. Above-ground hospitals did — but that meant joining the grid. Getting the nanobots. Becoming trackable.

She's been above ever since. Still welcome in both worlds, but can never go back to living below. Tina stayed.

### Sam

- Has been there a few times but rarely risks trips
- Smuggles things needed for survival
- Sends goat, eggs
- Siphons energy to them (see [[../../mystery/heist-mechanism|Heist Mechanism]])

### Eldest Son

- Really close with his aunt
- Gets resistance/legacy beliefs from mom and aunt

### [[../../characters/twin-sister|Tina]]

- One of the key providers in the colony
- Big family
- Unseen throughout the story
- The one who saved Ramona during the H₂S incident

## Sam's Involvement

### Why He Gets More Involved

Sam's colonization project keeps hitting the same walls. His models fail on problems the legacy humans solved 500 years ago. He needs their institutional knowledge:
- Water recycling gotchas
- Caloric efficiency tricks
- Ventilation failure modes
- Social scheduling that actually works
- What happens when the battery hits 15%

This data makes his colonization models actually useful. The irony: he's building escape plans for humanity using knowledge from the people who chose to stay.

### The Visits (2-3 max, risky for Sam)

**Visit 1 (Act 1 or early 2A):**
- Reason: Colonization project data. Realizes legacy humans have solved problems his models keep failing on.
- Gets cooperation by continuing/increasing energy support
- Sees the gravity battery for the first time

**Visit 2 (Act 2A):**
- Reason: Deeper technical consultation. Models are missing something.
- Blackmail element emerges — they want more than data exchange
- They want him to solve their energy problem permanently

**Visit 3 (Act 2B/3):**
- Reason: The heist. Needs the blind spot.
- Final deal: trades everything for their help

### After Simulation Reveal

Once Sam learns about the simulation, he digs into Glenn's data on survival rates:
- Underground populations die out sooner in vast majority of trials
- Occasionally outlasts above-ground
- Either way, both populations go extinct on current trajectory
- The simulation knows about legacy humans — they're tracked, just not worth the monitoring cost
- They're more fucked than honeycombers, not less

## In The Story

1. See them 2-3 times maximum
2. Hear about them throughout
3. Big influence over Ramona and oldest child
4. Very important to solving the ultimate problem (Sam needs their help for the heist)
5. Sam's colonization expertise makes him valuable to them; their real-world experience makes them valuable to him
