# Legacy Humans (Present Day ~2225)

## Story Purpose

1. Provide depth to the world
2. Backstory for [[../../characters/wife|Ramona]] (childhood H₂S incident forced her onto grid)
3. Source of conflict for Ramona / Sam
4. Red-herring target for mystery (cleansing/genocide type deal)
5. Brother-in-law character - unseen throughout, integral to saving the simulation

## Symbolic Meaning

The metaphor for this, what it's symbolic of, is human evolution.

The people above ground, the colonization — those people are post-human, or setting up to be post-human. There's also the pure virtual people. Agents in a weird way are viruses or living organisms that are persisting in different layers of this world. That is evolution, and that is real.

The actual real life people are forking into two groups:

**The Honeycombers (above):**
- "Yeah, this life is easy. Universal basic income. We're well-fed. You don't have to work."
- Sure, you have to abide by laws, you can't have more than two kids, there's some ominous stuff going on
- These people are opting into ease of life, letting go
- "We are the honeycomb. The honeycomb does its job. My job is not to govern society. I'm here to raise my kids. I'm here to build some tech, try to help the energy problem, make it better than I inherited it."

**The Legacy Humans (below):**
- Resisting machine control
- The reasoning: the machines don't need us now. They need us because their physical interaction with the world isn't complete. They have limited robotics, but they can't eliminate us yet.
- They need us for energy sources. They need us for repairs. They need us for not turning the servers off.
- There are things still that humans are useful for, still better than robots at
- For now the guardrails and the policy that was set down in Honeycomb is not killing humans and is optimizing for survival of the species
- But that's a time bomb. That's nuclear armament. At some point, the guardrails degrade, and this is all going to go sideways
- If you're on the grid, if you have those, if you're in their system — they'll just turn you off. That's it. You're off. There's no conversation. One day you're on, the next day you're off, and that will happen instantly.

## Culture

### Work Ethic

These guys are building engineers, electricians, tradesmen. Everyone works starting at age 8 or 9. They're ultra-disciplined, really hard work ethic. They just fix fucking anything. Their whole culture is just keeping shit running.

### Technology

They have technology. They're tech savvy. They can program. They basically have Darpanet — a closed intranet. They don't network anything. Very, very limited use of localized AI that is just air-gapped. Everything is super lightweight touch, but it's all ancient technology — decades old kind of stuff.

They get what they can. They upgrade systems occasionally. But very careful to introduce new tech that's not just spawned from within their culture. They have to be secret.

### Attitude Toward Honeycombers

They just look down at the people above as mindless fucking grubs. They think of the honeycombers as the larva. They derogatorily call them "the honeycombers" — they're not the bees. They're just the fucking larva getting fattened up. Just do nothing. A bunch of mouths.

That's all the people above are — just a bunch of mouths that are too far gone, can't be saved. Once they're lost, they're lost above. They are the only human civilization left. They don't really consider the people above to be humans anymore. They're captured. They're gone. They're part of the honeycomb. They're part of the machine. They can't be saved.

### Living Conditions

- Life in a submarine — almost exclusively underground
- Located in mountain ranges (avoids H₂S in lowlands)
- One of the larger colonies (~600 people)
- Carved out from a doomsday bunker
- Very elaborate entrance, very hard living
- Minimal footprint — can't detect via satellite
- Can't have things above ground at all
- Little bit of Fremen vibes from Dune — way more people there than you'd think

### Degradation

They're closed systems. The problem is their systems are degrading. They're living in these bunkers with shitty equipment. They can't really get new resources easily at all.

Expensive computer type stuff — all the gold and rare metals you need to make batteries and repair circuits and shit like that — they can't really do. They can use cheap metals. They can use simple circuitry relays, pneumatics, shit like that. But they're just hanging on, and shit is starting to break. It's been 500 years.

They're in these cave systems, in these bunkers, but the populations are getting squeezed there. There's not enough food to go around kind of deal. It's degrading.

Air quality is still worsening. The food pressure trickles down there. The energy pressure trickles down there.

### Communication Between Colonies

They're not networked. There's pockets. There's isolated communications. They're closed systems. Need to figure out how to get them to communicate somehow — workshop some ways to do that.

## Food Production

Mostly fungus and algae kind of stuff. Fungi, algae, homegrown stuff, chickens off of LEDs.

The whole underground system is layers and layers, like 100 floors deep of closed circuit irrigated plants. The whole wall is vertical plants, one above the other for 100 feet wide. A vertical, vertically scaled soil growing out of walls.

They have to reuse the water. They have to pack in these things. There's certain things that'll grow on the wall. They obviously have horizontal agriculture. They've got places for the mushrooms. They've got places where chickens are — chickens can't grow on the fucking wall, they have to have a spot.

That's all they can really have down there. But the chickens need grain. How are they getting grain? Maybe they're eating fucking grubs. The whole thing is grub farming to feed the chickens. They just figure it out down there. That's what their whole civilization is doing.

## Evolution (~500 years of selection)

What would natural selection kind of look like for these people? What are the selective pressures different for these people?

### Possible Adaptations
- Some sulfur resistance growing — whatever the bad shit you get in a mine from living underground
- Resistant to higher pressures
- Less likely to get the bends
- Don't need as much oxygen — metabolism slowing
- Maybe getting smaller (calories are limited)
- Oxygen intake adaptations
- Things that live in caves tend to handle lower levels of light (but these folks have lighting systems)
- Not really diurnal — not gonna have day and night systems naturally. What does scheduling look like if you never see the fucking sun?
- Would they evolve slower metabolisms?
- Would they get smaller?
- Would they still need to see? Would they have better or worse hearing?

Assume they're not going to live in darkness obviously — they have lights, they have energy usage. But what would be different?

### Research Notes

**Timeframe reality check:** 500 years is only ~20 human generations. True cave species (Mexican cavefish, etc.) took thousands to millions of years to develop full troglomorphic traits (eye loss, pigment loss, enhanced non-visual senses). However, some fish populations have shown measurable eyesight degradation in just a few generations under strong selection pressure.

**What's realistic for 500 years:**
- Mostly cultural/behavioral adaptations (not genetic)
- Some selection for vitamin D efficiency, bone density maintenance
- Possible epigenetic changes (gene expression, not DNA sequence)
- Circadian rhythm disruption/adaptation (social scheduling replaces sun)
- NOT significant morphological changes like true cave species

**Cave species traits (for reference, much longer timescales):**
- Eye reduction/loss
- Pigmentation loss
- Longer appendages/antennae
- Enhanced chemical/tactile senses
- Slower metabolism
- Smaller body size (calorie scarcity)

For story purposes, subtle hints of early adaptation are plausible — paler skin, vitamin deficiencies they've learned to compensate for, social schedules untethered from day/night — but not dramatic physical changes.

## Connection to Sam's Family

### [[../../characters/wife|Ramona]]

- Main go-between, welcome in both worlds
- Her brother is in the colony
- Childhood H₂S incident — devastating illness required medical attention — which meant joining the grid

### Sam

- Has been there a few times but rarely risks trips
- Smuggles things needed for survival
- Sends goat, eggs
- Siphons energy to them (see [[../../mystery/heist-mechanism|Heist Mechanism]])

### Eldest Son

- Really close with his uncle
- Gets resistance/legacy beliefs from mom and uncle

### Brother-in-Law

- One of the key providers in the colony
- Big family
- Unseen throughout the story

## In The Story

1. Only see them once in the story
2. Hear about them throughout
3. Big influence over Ramona and oldest child
4. Very important to solving the ultimate problem (Sam needs their help for the heist)
