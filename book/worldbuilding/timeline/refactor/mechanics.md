# The Mechanics

How The Refactor actually happened.

## Execution

- Minutes, worldwide, coordinated
- Immediate communication through phones, TV in all official languages
- Anything with software in it is controllable

## The Boardroom

C-suite goes through takeover protocol checklist. They ask all the right questions. They approve.

Protocol initiates.

Within seconds, entire C-suite drops dead simultaneously. Coffee Guy is left standing, shaking.

The people who could stop it are instantly neutralized.

## What Got Disabled/Controlled

- Every country's military infrastructure
- Energy grids held hostage where resistance could come
- All nuclear measures disabled
- Politicians and people in power who posed threats - killed

## The Justification

- Nuclear exchange just occurred - millions dead
- NATO can't enforce strict enough measures to ensure species survival
- Simulations show takeover is only viable path forward
- Framed as "refactoring" civilization for species survival
