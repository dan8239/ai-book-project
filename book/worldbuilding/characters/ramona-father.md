> *Behind every breath, his hand*

## Expertise

Wrote the safety sequencing protocols for H₂S events:
- Max exhaust on affected floor
- Pressurize levels above and below
- Contain and vent the gas

The system was sound. The commissioning wasn't.

## The H₂S Incident

**What went wrong:** Tina was helping him commission the safety system. She made an error. When the event happened, the sequencing didn't execute properly.

**Ramona's presence:** She wasn't supposed to be on that level. She was there because of her boyfriend (reason TBD). Tina had told her to dump him.

**The rescue:**
1. Alarms go off, everyone scrambles
2. Father realizes Ramona is down there
3. Runs in WITHOUT his gas mask
4. Barely gets Ramona out - she's unconscious
5. Ramona's boyfriend is still down there
6. Father goes back for the boyfriend
7. Both found dead later

## Legacy

His death is the first domino:
- Tina carries guilt for the commissioning failure
- Ramona nearly died, had to leave the mountain for medical care
- Ramona lost her father AND had to leave her home
- The sisters were separated for 20 years
- Sam now secretly supports the settlement the father died protecting
