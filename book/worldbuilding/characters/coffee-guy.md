# Coffee Guy

**Name:** Damon (Greek: *to tame, to subdue* — also the loyal friend from Damon and Pythias)
**Age:** TBD
**Era:** [[../timeline/real-world-2025|Real World (2025)]]
**Company:** [[../world/organizations/quant|Quant]]

## Role

Exceptionally competent. Not just a technician.

He is using [[Glenn "Big Dog" Robinson]] and sophisticated qubit software to generate a global policy that will optimize for human survival. He knows exactly what the simulations are for.

## Daily Work
- Reviews histograms
- Tracks average civilization die-out rates
- Compiles trial statistics
- Monthly meetings scheduled to deliver standard updates

## The Breakthrough Moment

**What changed:** This is the first simulation to break through.

In RL learning you need a truly successful event. Nothing has broken through yet. They've extended years before, gotten a few thousand years even, but never really broken to survival being an afterthought. This is like the first successful RL trial that will be the tipping point where the policy actually becomes good.

**The numbers:** First simulation to break through the low teens to essentially guaranteed survival on a huge time horizon (100k years). He'll need more time but convergence is all but guaranteed.

**Why it matters:** Once RL has found any pathway the door is creased open. It will keep wedging that doorway open farther, do it more quickly, lose less people in the process. It's inevitable. He'll need a few more hours, maybe days, but it's going to work.

**His action:** Shows up IN PERSON to monthly meeting (shocking for his position)

**Office context:** Extremely small for company scale - 10x less people than Google today (~2,500 total)

**What happens:** Somehow gets into C-suite decision meeting, presents findings, then excused from the room.

## Ending Action
Goes to get coffee while the world changes.

## Arc Notes
Coffee Guy has a **Flat/Ironic Arc** - he doesn't change, and that's the point. He embodies the "reports no one reads" theme.

```
Routine → Notices anomaly → Presents to C-suite → Dismissed → Back to routine
         (while the world changes around him)
```

**Promise:** We see him monitoring dashboards, bored routine
**Progress:** He notices the breakthrough, gets excited, presents
**Payoff:** He's excused from the room, goes to get coffee while humanity's fate is decided
