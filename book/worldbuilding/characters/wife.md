# Ramona Motu-Spencer

**Name:** Ramona Motu-Spencer (née Spencer)
**Gender:** Woman
**Age:** 31
**Era:** [[../timeline/sim-present|Sim Present (~2225)]]
**Background:** Earth Systems Science, grew up in the mountain (legacy human settlement)
**Religion:** Raised Christian (doesn't really practice, but knows the stories/proverbs)

## Role
Protagonist's wife. Mother of their children. The thematic heart of the story - embodies the truth protagonist needs to learn.

## Education & Career

**Field:** Earth Systems Science (prior to kids)

Studied broad interconnected systems - geology, climate, soil, water cycles, ecology. Can read rock strata like history - each colored stripe represents millions of years. Sees the mountain as a record of time. Understands why alkaline soil means certain plants, why desertification changed the watershed, how the rock determines the soil determines what grows.

Sam doesn't care as much (he's in the clouds), but she notices.

This expertise lets her explain the landscape to Sam (and the reader) during the gondola chapter - the metamorphic rock, red rock, shale, mudstone, sandstone. The dry canyons carved by water that no longer flows. The mountain as a metaphor for snapshots in time.

Also knows about middens - can explain how ancient civilizations' population was estimated by shellfish shell piles (Andes example, ~15,000 years ago).

## Religious Background

Grew up Christian in the mountain settlement. Doesn't really practice anymore, but knows all the stories and proverbs. Sam grew up atheist outside the mountain. They don't fight about it - just tease each other lovingly.

**Example exchange (Mountain chapter, Eye of the Needle):**
- Ramona references "easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle..."
- Sam: "Why would I know that proverb?"
- Ramona explains: Jerusalem had a gate called the Eye of the Needle. Camels had to kneel to get through - humble themselves.
- Sam: "I've never heard the proverb, why would I know the subtext?"
- Ramona: "It's not a proverb, it's... heathens. Freaking atheists."
- Teasing, loving exchange

## Situation
- Pregnant with 3rd child (taboo in this society)
- Beautiful, loving, stressed
- Signaling she needs help (he's missing it)
- On-grid (lives within the system like her husband)
- Has a twin sister ([[twin-sister|Tina]]) living off-grid in a legacy human settlement

## Why She's On-Grid

### The H₂S Incident

Ramona wasn't supposed to be on that level. She was there because of her boyfriend (reason TBD). Tina had told her to dump him.

When the alarms went off, her [[ramona-father|father]]—an HVAC technician who wrote the safety sequencing protocols—ran in WITHOUT his gas mask. He barely got Ramona out. She was unconscious.

Her boyfriend was still down there. Her father went back for him. They found both bodies later.

**What she lost:**
- Her father
- Her home (had to leave the mountain for medical care)
- Her sister (20-year separation)
- Her boyfriend (though she doesn't mourn him)

### The Boyfriend

Sam doesn't bring it up. Ever.

At some point he asks if she loved him. She says she hates him. She thought she did at the time. If she'd dumped him like Tina said she should, she never would have been in that location.

She resents him. If he wasn't there—if he'd never made her go—her dad would still be alive. She'd still have a dad. She'd still be in the mountain.

Though... she wouldn't have met Sam. Wouldn't have her kids.

**She's processed all of these feelings. Sam hasn't.**

### Medical Aftermath

Ramona recovered above-ground, but the long-term respiratory effects couldn't be treated below. The colony didn't have the medical tech. Above-ground hospitals did—but that meant joining the grid. Getting the nanobots. Becoming trackable.

## Tina (Twin Sister)

Tina is in a legacy human settlement (off-grid). The one who saved her. She loves her.

Her husband secretly diverts energy to support the settlement.

### The 20-Year Separation

Since the H₂S incident forced Ramona above-ground:
- Letters have been their main connection
- Tina occasionally visits above-ground (risky, incognito, can't use AI services)
- Ramona has NEVER gone back—too dangerous. She's on-grid. Repeated visits = investigation = "turned off"

Sam made an enormous donation to fund a mining museum restoration, creating a tourism facade. First time Ramona can safely visit.

### The Jealousy (After First Contact)

Once the museum cover is operational, Sam starts going to the settlement regularly for optimization work. Ramona becomes jealous of the time Sam spends with Tina. Complicated feeling — she loves them both, wants them to get along, but also feels left out. Sam goes more often than she does. They share something work-related she's excluded from.

### Ramona's Visit

Ramona visits the colony. During this visit, Tina finds out what Sam's research is actually for — colonization, escape plans for the rich. The betrayal comes out through Ramona, not Sam. Makes it worse.

## What She Wants
- More of the aquarium scene - real world presence
- To raise kids the right way, together
- For him to be HERE, not just providing

She trusts that humans can innovate out of whatever is coming. The purpose is to experience it together.

## Her Philosophy
"This is the only trial we get."

She says this before she knows it's literally true.

**On the crisis:** Boy who cried wolf. How many times did people think it was the end of the world? You do your best and forget the rest. It's bad but it's not her job or role in society.

**On simulation revelation:** "Who cares? If we're in a simulation or we're not, how does it change my life? If god exists or he doesn't, I still have to get my kids to school today and feed them."

## Character Arc

**Arc Type:** Flat Arc - She's right all along. He learns what she already knows.

### The Conflict Progression

| Phase | What protagonist thinks the problem is | What she's actually signaling |
|-------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Early (Act 1) | Money - worried about 3rd kid | Money isn't really the issue |
| Middle (Act 2A) | Still money - throws money at it (nanny, bigger place) | Flattered but it doesn't fix anything |
| Later (Act 2B) | Finally realizes: time/presence | Being a family was always the issue |

### Key Scene: The Reveal

He's clearly lying about something (the simulation discovery). She thinks he's cheating on her. Tension builds until he tells her the truth.

**Her response:** Believes him. Doesn't care.

"If we're in a simulation or we're not, how does it change my life? If he shuts it off will I even notice or will it just end?"

### Gives Him the Idea

"If I could choose to keep it running I would. But I'll be happy with every minute we get."

This somehow plants the seed for his plan to copy the simulation to the hidden server.

*[Refine the exact mechanism later]*

## Economic Context

This world is UBI-based due to AI:
- 1 kid: UBI covers it
- 2 kids: Need an occupation
- 3 kids: Very taboo, heavily penalized financially

His new colonization job relieves the money pressure for kid #3. He thinks this solves the problem. It doesn't.

## Relationship to Protagonist

She's what he's been neglecting while trying to save the world. The irony: he can't save Earth, but he CAN save his family - the thing he learned to value.
