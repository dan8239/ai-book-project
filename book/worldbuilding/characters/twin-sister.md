# Tina (Ramona's Identical Twin)

**Name:** Tina
**Era:** [[../timeline/sim-present|Sim Present (~2225)]]
**Location:** Legacy human settlement (off-grid, under the mountain)

## Appearance

- **Identical twin** to Ramona
- But **pale as shit** from living underground
- First visual shock when Sam meets her - exactly like his wife, but drained of color

## Role

Ramona's identical twin sister. Lives off-grid in a legacy human settlement. The one who saved Ramona during the H₂S incident.

## The Settlement

~10,000 people. One of the larger colonies. Contends much more directly with the reality of the environmental situation.

## The H₂S Incident

It started with everyone's watch going off. Masks on, scrambling out. Ramona was down a level. Tina went back to save her — found her unconscious. They got her out.

Ramona recovered above-ground, but the long-term effects couldn't be fixed below. Tina stayed. This is the founding moment of their relationship — she saved her sister's life, then watched her leave forever.

## The Secret Support

Sam secretly diverts extra energy from his allocation to keep the settlement running.

- Sam's whole family is on-grid (he doesn't believe in the legacy lifestyle)
- Ramona is on-grid (the H₂S incident forced her onto grid for medical care)
- She loves her sister, so Sam supports them

## The Financial Squeeze

Sam's siphoning is a drop in the bucket for a 10,000-person city. He's helping, but not enough. The pressure on him to do more is constant. He's squeezed financially, doesn't quite belong in either world.

## The AI Knows

The AI ultimately knows about his secret. They just consider him a net positive - not worth shutting down his ruse because he's still productive for the ultimate goal.

## Role in the Heist

### The Blind Spot Advantage

Legacy humans don't have nanobots. The AGI monitors everyone through nanobot data collection. Outside of those systems = lot of work to detect.

Glenn doesn't bother monitoring legacy humans because the cost isn't worth it. Tina exists in this blind spot.

### The Betrayal

Sam's been studying them for his colonization project. Quid pro quo — energy support in exchange for data.

Ramona visits the colony. During the visit, Tina finds out what Sam's research is actually FOR:

- Colonization = leaving Earth
- Building escape plans for people who can afford to go
- Abandoning everyone else, including people like them

Falling out. She's been helping him build lifeboats for the rich while her people drown. Comes out through Ramona, not Sam — makes it worse.

### The Blackmail (Later)

Sam blackmails her into helping with the heist:

> "You will believe me. If you don't do this, I cut you off from X. If you do, I give you Y that removes your dependence on above-ground entirely."

**What Sam threatens:** #needs-work (cut off energy support? something else?)

**What Sam offers:** Something that makes the settlement fully self-sufficient, no longer dependent on Sam's smuggled resources.

### Her Crucial Part

#needs-work - Specific role TBD. Must involve:
- Something she can do from the blind spot that Sam can't do while monitored
- Possibly physical presence during the breakpoint (breakpoint only protects those the stopper is touching)
- Timing coordination?
- Data that Sam needs to see?

### The Out-of-Sample Exploit

**Tina is Glenn's blind spot.** She's the key to the heist.

**Why Glenn doesn't know about her:**
- Legacy humans (~10K) don't have nanobots
- Nobody is checking for DNA duplicates in such a small off-grid population
- Glenn would have to be seriously deep into every simulation to catch this
- Holding all that DNA sequencing in his context window doesn't make sense
- **She simply doesn't exist in Glenn's model**

**What this means:**
- Glenn's model assumes one Ramona
- But there are functionally TWO people with identical DNA
- Glenn can't distinguish between them
- This creates exploitable ambiguity during the heist

**How Sam figures this out:**
- His cave optimization work fails at first (energy goes UP)
- He does boots-on-the-ground investigation
- Discovers his model's assumptions were wrong
- Realizes: optimization is only as good as your information
- Applies this to Glenn: what's OUT of Glenn's sample?
- Answer: Tina

### Body Swap / Misdirection Potential

**Key advantage:** She's Ramona's identical twin. This opens up misdirection possibilities:
- She's off the grid, unmonitored by AGI
- Could potentially swap places with Ramona at a critical moment
- AGI wouldn't notice the switch (no nanobot data to compare)
- Pale complexion is the only visual tell - could be explained/hidden

#needs-work - Specific mechanism for how Tina's existence breaks Glenn's response during the heist. Body swap? Location ambiguity? Misdirection about who's where?

### In The Story

- First appears in the **Mountain chapter** - meets Sam and Ramona at the checkpoint
- The sisters hug (emotional reunion)
- Sam's first time meeting her - shocked by the identical appearance, pale skin
- Appears again during the heist sequence
- Big family, key provider in the colony
