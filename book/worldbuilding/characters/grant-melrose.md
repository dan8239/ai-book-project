# Grant Melrose

**Name:** Grant Melrose
**Era:** [[../timeline/real-world-2025|Real World (2025)]]
**Company:** [[../world/organizations/quant|Quant]]

## Who He Is

- Zuckerberg-type figure nearing deathbed
- Larger than life, buying up suspicious companies
- Getting sued everywhere for monopolizing
- Basically owns the most important governments
- His last act: usher in the next era of general intelligence

## The Call To Action

Nuclear exchange happened. Climate cascade locked in. The trajectory is undeniable.

This is what created the call to action. The simulations weren't theoretical anymore - they were urgent. This is what he's optimizing for.

## Project Day-Kart

Named for Descartes → "I think therefore I am"

See [[../world/organizations/quant#Project Day-Kart|Quant - Project Day-Kart]] for full details.

### The Consciousness Copy Project

- Started as attempt to copy Grant Melrose's consciousness
- Moderate but unprovable success
- The philosophical problem: How do you distinguish between an agent that is just acting like him and actual consciousness?
- You ask it questions, it seems like him, responds like him, but he's still himself
- The AGI immediately surpasses his consciousness / personality quirks
- Becomes way more than he was - nothing of himself even in there anymore
- **They still refer to the thing as "him" though**

### What The AGI Becomes

- Takes the form of GPU infrastructure (~9% of planetary energy use)
- Redundancy all over the planet
- Main directive: continuation of the human species
- Moral guardrails aligned with Grant Melrose's principles (diversity, equal rights, etc. - current political feelings in vogue)
- **Primary loss function takes over and deteriorates the guardrails over time as pressures continue**

## The Ranch — Verde Valley, AZ

**Name:** TBD
**Location:** Verde Valley, Arizona — cliffside property overlooking the river valley

**The Property:**
- Enormous — absurd wealth made physical
- Rivers, cliffside views, wild game, horseback riding trails
- Drive-in epoxied spotless garage with dozens of high-end vehicles
- **The Main Room:** Cantilevered floor-to-ceiling window overhanging the cliff's edge
- **Transparent floor** — like Willis Tower Skydeck, looking straight down to the valley
- Thousands of wild cattle below, near the river

**Narrative Role:**
- Where Melrose is dying. Hospice care, in secret.
- Cover story: "at his ranch" (technically true)
- Coffee Guy is the only person who knows the truth
- The most beautiful room in the world, with a dying man in it

## Cultural Legacy (Post-Refactor)

- Grant Melrose's name is everywhere
- The consciousness copy story is known
- The AGI immediately surpassing him is known
- They still call the AGI "him" even though nothing of him remains
- History is heavily censored - he's mythologized
