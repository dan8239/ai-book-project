# Temp / Trainee

**Name:** TBD
**Era:** [[../timeline/sim-present|Sim Present (~2125)]]

## Role

Statistical / PhD type that [[Sam|Protagonist]] is getting up to speed on his optimization work.

## Narrative Function

**Exposition device:** Through training sessions with the temp, we learn:
- The food situation (running out)
- Basic "how/why" of the crisis
- Working knowledge of the world state

This lets protagonist focus on "making the faucet bigger" while the temp provides the statistical/scientific context of WHY they're in this situation.

## Characterization

- Statistical background
- PhD-level education
- Knows the macro picture (population trajectory, food math, climate causes)
- Can explain in remedial terms how they got here
- Contrast to protagonist's "just optimize" approach

## What They Know

Basic understanding of:
- Peak population (18-20B) and decline
- The cloud breakup / temperature cascade
- Why models were wrong
- Current food production vs. population math
- The "standard scientist view" - we'll stabilize at 10M-1B

Does NOT know:
- The guillotine (ozone collapse / true extinction trajectory)
- Classified colonization urgency
- Simulation reality
