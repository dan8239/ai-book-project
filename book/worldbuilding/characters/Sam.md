# Sam Sp

**Name:** Sam
**Gender:** Male
**Age:** 31
**Era:** [[../timeline/sim-present|Sim Present (~2225)]]
**Location:** [[../world/rossland|Rossland]], BC Kootenays

## Hometown

Sam is from Rossland. Grew up there. Still lives there with his family.

He works remotely — lives in the clouds (metaverse) more than the physical world. Barely notices the dying ski town around him, the changed ecosystem, the faded grandeur. He's always in meetings, always optimizing, always somewhere else.

Met [[wife|Ramona]] there. She's from the legacy human settlement in the mountain. The H₂S incident forced her above-ground for medical care. She ended up in Rossland. They met. She stayed.

The irony: he lives in one of the most interesting physical places on Earth — and barely sees it. The legacy humans 500m below him are more present in the physical world than he is.

## Role

**Not a food scientist**—he's a contractor/builder in [[../world/honeycomb|Honeycomb]].

### How He Works
- Takes **Controller positions** on short contracts (local hex, family unit, etc.)
- Posts **open source projects** that sometimes get funded/forked
- Gets **royalties** when his projects scale
- Still does **human→machine projects**: prototypes solutions that get picked up and maintained by AGI

### How He Made His Money
Built the **M&V (Measurement & Verification) system** that underpins all of Honeycomb's economic measurement:
- Automated energy savings validation
- Canary releases, A/B testing
- Baseline / counterfactual modeling
- Representative sampling
- Out-of-the-box billing

He doesn't have to worry about money but isn't famous in any way—like someone who wrote TCP/IP but isn't a household name.

### Current Contract
**Food chain optimization**—agricultural ML work. This is how he gets called up to the colonization project.

Originally a 6-month contract that's been extended at-will. He's not used to such a long commitment. He's been on it for way too long and he's basically fulfilled it. He's now an at-will employee for this system.

The temp in 01.03.work is who he's bringing on to replace him.

### What Makes Him Rare
Most people just work on AI-originated projects. Sam still originates work that AGI later adopts and maintains. This is increasingly unusual.


## Motivation

### What does he want?

He wants to be somebody that matters. He wants to do a big thing that will save his name in time and leave a legacy. That's why he keeps doing stuff even though he doesn't need to.

### Why can't he have it?

The world is ending and nothing he does will matter. The simulation will be compressed.

### What does he need?

To realize presence with his family IS enough. Legacy doesn't matter.

### What does he sacrifice to get it?

- His wealth independence (gives 99%+ of his energy credits to the underground folks to get their help)
- His job and contract with the colonization project (quits)
- Back to ground zero — on basic income, back to square one
- But he's happier than at the beginning when he had seemingly everything

### What doesn't he want people to know about him?

### What in this character's history informs why they do what they do?

Someone close to him died due to an oversight? Or maybe not directly that but adjacent to it. Perhaps father or mother.

### What failure will he never repeat?

Need something here that explains why he is capable of actually solving the problem where all the other simulations didn't.

### How / why is he different from the other 850M simulations? What leap does he take?

He's not special. He's just the first to get there.

### How does he deal with that failure or punish himself?

Blames himself for it. Gallows humor on the surface. Humor as defense mechanism. Humor to not get close to people.

## Personality

How does the character express what they want out of life?

## Values

What are they willing to do or give up to get what they want?

### Quirks

**Territorial about his spaces**

Sam is very particular about his personal areas:
- His sink
- His nightstand
- His dresser
- His desk

He doesn't like people in his space. Everything has a place. He knows where things are. When someone moves something, he notices immediately.

This isn't about cleanliness - it's about control. His spaces are the few things in life he can actually control. (Connects to his optimization mindset - he's optimized these spaces and doesn't want variables introduced.)

### Flaws

**Core Flaw: Blind belief in optimization and systems**

Sam believes that every problem has an optimal solution, and that finding it is just a matter of running enough simulations, tuning enough parameters, and analyzing enough data. He treats life like a loss function to minimize.

This flaw is:
- What makes him good at his job (optimization is literally his expertise)
- What blinds him to his family (he's optimizing for legacy instead of presence)
- What Glenn shares (both are "optimal choice" thinkers)
- What Sam ultimately exploits to beat Glenn

**The Irony:** His optimization mindset is both his greatest strength AND how he defeats Glenn. He recognizes Glenn will always choose the "optimal" answer - and uses that predictability against him.

**Arc:** He must learn that some things can't be optimized. His family doesn't need an optimal solution. They just need him to be present.

### Limitations

### Hinderances

Morals and family

## CPR

### Competence

Medium to high early, only accelerates as he learns more. How does he become more competent?

### Proactivity

Low to start, gets higher over time

### Relatability

Try to keep this high. Regular guy. Listens to the rules. Trying to help the problem and do his best.

## Job & Expertise
His job is enormous - related to optimal food production. He makes small incremental improvements, but in the midst of discussion about minor improvements, he and his agentic army show how far ahead they are of us.

**Expertise areas:**
- Hyperparameter optimization
- Genetic algorithms
- Multi-objective optimization
- Loss function design for agricultural systems

**Approach to genetics:** Treats genetics as optimization problems - converts biological questions into loss functions, tunes selection pressures, Pareto front analysis. Does a lot of Monte Carlo with changes to the gene pool of crops, changes in yield, tolerances, metabolism, byproducts.

## Major Projects
- **Qubit Waste Bacteria** - Emergent bacteria that processes waste products of qubit production. Breeding program to optimize metabolic rate, speciate for different waste products.
- **Sustainable Yield Improvements** - Works closely with geneticists for plant genetics improvements
- **Drought Resistant Corn**
- **Nitrogen Fixers**
- **Topsoil Regeneration** - Faster ways to turn things back into topsoil
- **Sustainable Meat** - Economically sustainable way to eat meat at scale

## Research Method
Runs statistical life simulations on genetic data. His job is a huge ecological optimization engine.

**Style:** Simple, statistical, elegant - like evolutionary algorithm videos with creatures bumping around, breeding, dying. Not detailed individuals, just population dynamics.

**Questions asked:** Given DNA + resource constraints, what percentage develop cooperation vs defection after N generations?

**The Meta Horror:** He's running simplified statistical simulations on genetic data. He IS a simplified statistical simulation based on genetic data. He sees elegance in his sims. Someone above sees elegance in HIM.

## Team Structure
His team is literally his best friend robot with specialized hyper functional agents that work asynchronously. They have extremely long projects and can self-organize.

**Works with:** [[claude-assistants|Claude assistants]] and AI agent team
**Collaborates with:** [[co-worker-geneticist|Co-worker]] (statistical geneticist)

**Collaboration dynamic:** He does the loss function and optimization; she guides the genetics, guardrails, limits, mutation rates.

## Story Progression
1. **Starts:** Agricultural optimization job, food production at scale
2. **Call up:** Gets promoted to colonization/re-seed program - learns true dire state of Earth
3. **Mystery begins:** Needs genetic diversity for colony, finds weird dataset in 23andMe-type DB (planted by DevSecOps woman)

### The Cave Optimization Arc (Key Learning Moment)

Sam takes on a side project optimizing energy use for the legacy humans' underground settlement. This becomes crucial to the heist.

**Month 1: Failure**
- Sam applies his standard optimization models
- Result: Energy consumption goes UP, not down
- His models are making things worse

**The Investigation:**
- Sam has to do boots-on-the-ground work
- Actually visits the settlement (First Contact chapter)
- Sees the reality vs. his assumptions
- Discovers the model was optimizing for incorrect things
- Underground life doesn't match above-ground assumptions

**The Fix:**
- Adjusts the model with real observational data
- Results improve dramatically
- The system works once the inputs are correct

**The Lesson:**
> "Optimization is only as good as your information. Out-of-sample data breaks models."

**Application to Glenn:**
- Sam realizes Glenn has the same weakness
- Glenn's model doesn't account for everything
- What's OUT of Glenn's sample?
- Answer: **Tina** - identical twin, off-grid, invisible to monitoring
- This becomes the key to the heist

## Career Mindset (Early Story)

Sam is kind of bored, but not existentially bored. He's had enough. His contract is fulfilled. He doesn't really need money.

He's mostly thinking about taking some time. He's like, "I don't need to work. I've got enough credits left. We could live for the rest of my life without it." He doesn't need to do any of this stuff. He's just doing it to find purpose.

Early in the book he's talking with [[wife|Ramona]] about maybe it's time to retire. He's already 34. He's not getting any younger.

This shows how the typical career is much shorter. Nobody's grinding for 50 years anymore for work because most people don't have to work at all. You're working for extra credits. Your energy already takes care of life support, food, healthcare, education — all that is covered. All that is part of your existence bill. The only thing extra to that is what you electively use.

## Relationships
- **Relationship to [[devsecops-woman|DevSecOps Woman]]:** TBD (thematic parallel matters more than genealogy)
- **Wife:** [[wife|Ramona]] - pregnant with 3rd child
- **Children:** 2 kids + 1 on the way (3rd is taboo/penalized in this society)

### Wife Relationship Arc

| Phase | What he thinks the problem is | Reality |
|-------|-------------------------------|---------|
| Act 1 (early) | Nothing — he's about to do something important | She wants him present for 3rd kid |
| Act 2A | The job is the problem — once it's done he'll be around | She's closing off, gravitating back toward Tina's world |
| Act 2B | Finally realizes: time/presence | Being a family was always the issue |

**Key scene:** He's clearly hiding something (simulation discovery). She thinks he's cheating. He tells her the truth. She believes him but doesn't care: "If we're in a simulation or not, how does it change my life?"

**She gives him the idea:** "If I could choose to keep it running I would. But I'll be happy with every minute we get." → He reframes from "stop Big Dog" to "keep us running"

### Try/Fail with Big Dog (before wife's insight)

Before landing on the real solution, he tries confrontational approaches that fail:
- Quitting the work
- Bargaining
- Threatening
- All fail → wife's line reframes the problem

## Personality Traits
TBD

## Character Arc

### Want / Need / Flaw

- **Flaw:** Lives in the clouds — tech-obsessed, always optimizing, never present. Prioritizes legacy over the people in front of him.
- **Lie he believes:** Legacy is meaning. If his name outlasts him, he mattered.
- **Want:** Legacy — his name on every planet, remembered as the one who saved humanity.
- **Need:** To realize presence with his family IS enough. Being here matters more than being remembered.
- **Irony:** He can't save Earth. But he CAN save his simulation family — the thing he learned to value is the thing he can actually protect.

**The arc:** He starts in the clouds chasing legacy. He ends on the ground, present with his family.

### Arc Trajectory

**Start:** In the clouds — tech-obsessed, optimizing, chasing legacy. Wife begging him to be present. He thinks the colonization project will make him matter.

**End:** On the ground, present. Lets go of legacy. Only cares about his family. Acts (saves the simulation) even knowing it might not matter.

### Mystery Thread

1. Working on colonization genetic payload
2. Government seed data has bottleneck problem - effective population too small
3. Needs older/more diverse genetic strains
4. Looks for specific datasets - relatives, extinct animals
5. Finds weird dataset - wrong location, old format, not properly ingested (planted by devsecops woman in 23andMe-type DB)
6. Processes it, realizes through testing it's the seed data - all human diversity traces back to this one file
7. Timestamps/metadata make no sense
8. Keeps pulling thread → Big Dog reveals truth
