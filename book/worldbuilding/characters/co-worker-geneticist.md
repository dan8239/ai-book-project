# Co-Worker (Statistical Geneticist)

**Name:** TBD
**Gender:** TBD
**Age:** TBD
**Era:** [[../timeline/sim-present|Sim Present (~2125)]]

## Role
Statistical Geneticist - DNA domain expert who works closely with [[Sam|Protagonist]].

## Expertise
- Population genetics
- GWAS (genome-wide association studies)
- Demographic modeling
- Statistical inference from DNA
- Identifies what genetic patterns mean biologically

**Questions she asks:** What does this genetic signal tell us?

## Collaboration Dynamic
Takes most of the DNA expertise from the protagonist. Understands what genetic patterns mean - interprets population bottlenecks, linkage disequilibrium, selection signatures.

- Co-worker identifies interesting genetic questions
- [[Sam|Protagonist]] builds optimization frameworks to answer them
- Co-worker validates results biologically

**Opening line:** "What are you optimizing for?"

## Team Structure
Both protagonist and co-worker are hyper exceptional at their job but basically run a small staff that are all autonomous (all AI agents). They go off on LONG projects - work as long as you tell them, set goals and they optimize for that goal until it's solved.

## Relationship to Protagonist
Work colleague (NOT romantic interest). They work closely together for various projects at their company.

## Key Lines

> "We haven't changed a bit. It's easy to think of ancient humans as stupid or cavemen. Human DNA has remained essentially unchanged for 300,000 years. If time travel was real and you swapped your son with one from 250,000 B.C. at 10 years old, you'd still have a kid building robots, and your son wouldn't have seen a campfire in his entire life."

Seeds the colonization problem — the DNA isn't the issue. Humans are adaptable. The environment is the variable.

## Personality Traits
