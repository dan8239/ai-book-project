# Co-Worker (Statistical Geneticist)

**Name:** TBD
**Gender:** TBD
**Age:** TBD
**Era:** [[../timeline/sim-present|Sim Present (~2225)]]

## Role
Statistical Geneticist - DNA domain expert who works closely with [[protagonist|Protagonist]].

## Expertise
- Population genetics
- GWAS (genome-wide association studies)
- Demographic modeling
- Statistical inference from DNA
- Identifies what genetic patterns mean biologically

**Questions she asks:** What does this genetic signal tell us?

## Collaboration Dynamic
Takes most of the DNA expertise from the protagonist. Understands what genetic patterns mean - interprets population bottlenecks, linkage disequilibrium, selection signatures.

- Co-worker identifies interesting genetic questions
- [[protagonist|Protagonist]] builds optimization frameworks to answer them
- Co-worker validates results biologically

**Opening line:** "What are you optimizing for?"

## Team Structure
Both protagonist and co-worker are hyper exceptional at their job but basically run a small staff that are all autonomous (all AI agents). They go off on LONG projects - work as long as you tell them, set goals and they optimize for that goal until it's solved.
