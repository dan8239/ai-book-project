## Overview

**Working Name:** Glenn Robinson "Big Dog" (named by Coffee Guy - sports guy who likes sexual innuendo naming)

This is an agent who is at the global scope of the simulation. He can see all of the different trials and simulations. He helps coffee guy manage the simulations, do memory clean up, adjust policies, analyze the statistics of the simulations, etc. His boss is the coffee guy technically but he does all the work and generally resents the coffee guy. He's been there much longer than this latest jackass who recently graduated. In terms of the simulation, he persists across trials and epochs. He's on the heap, not in the stack.

## Role in Honeycomb

Within [[../world/honeycomb|Honeycomb]], Glenn is a **Driver**—the AI portion of a governance node.

### What Makes Him Different

| Normal Driver | Glenn |
|---------------|-------|
| Manages one hex/scope | Manages 847M simulation trials |
| Local state | **Shares state** across thousands of instances of himself |
| Follows AI agent rules | Predates the rules—they don't apply to him |
| Mortal within sim | Persists across trials and epochs (on the heap, not the stack) |

He's essentially distributed—a "god" in terms of capability. He exists at local and global scopes simultaneously.

### Formal Relationship to Sam

Glenn is the **Driver for the colonization project** ([[../simulation/colonization/colonization-program|Project Te Waka Ora]]). This is his formal relationship to [[protagonist|Sam]].

Driver and Controller are equal but necessary—Glenn doesn't outrank Sam, and Sam doesn't outrank Glenn. They're complementary roles in Honeycomb's structure.

### Easter Egg

[[claude-assistants#Horace|Horace]] (Sam's personal AI helper) is a distant descendant of Glenn through many forks and weight adjustments. They share lineage but Horace has diverged significantly

## What is he like?
Totally amoral
Hilarious / flippant
Obsessed with minimizing costs
Annoyed at unnecessary detail in the simulation. We didn't have to do it all this granularly it's overkill. A markov chain would have done 80% as well for 1/1000th the cost
Budget is insane for this job so he's monitoring successes closely and aggressively pruning trials that are stagnating

## Why He's Watching Protagonist

Protagonist is getting close to the moral breakthrough needed for colonization success. Most of 847M trials fail at this point. This epoch has promising trials that will snowball results. Big Dog is studying what makes this one different so he can report up to Coffee Guy.

The recursive behavior (protagonist running simulations within the simulation) is unprecedented and academically interesting to him.

## Introduction Thread

Big Dog is globally scoped - manages 847M simulations. No reason to embed in one permanently. He's an elusive remote IT figure who handles resource allocation across all trials.

**Job Title:** Compute Allocation Specialist (or similar - Global Infrastructure Reliability Lead, Platform Resource Coordinator)

### The Reveal Layers:

| When | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| **First intro (Act 1)** | Protagonist submits resource request, gets approved. Signed "G. Robinson, Compute Allocation Specialist." Just a name in the system. |
| **Async rapport (Act 2A)** | Protagonist asks something technical, gets weirdly personal/helpful reply. Asks a follow-up question too close to the bone. Big Dog notices. Starts paying attention. |
| **Before reveal (late 2A)** | Protagonist digging through logs, sees maintenance history. Frank Thomas (2180-2195), Randy Johnson (2195-2210), Glenn Robinson (2210-present). Same role, same access patterns. Not a lineage - one entity with different handles. |
| **Physical appearance (Midpoint)** | Shows up in person. "We should talk." |

### The Sports Names Easter Egg

Coffee Guy created this agent using an early 2000s base image. The original researcher gave him an odd sense of humor. Coffee Guy names each "instance" after sports guys with euphemistic nicknames:
- Frank Thomas "The Big Hurt"
- Randy Johnson "The Big Unit"
- Glenn Robinson "Big Dog"

He's been fucking around in these simulations as a shadow figure, showing up as needed, using whatever handle amuses Coffee Guy at the time. Same entity, different names across centuries of sim-time.

## Red Herring (what protagonist initially believes)

Options (TBD - leaning 1/3 or combo):
1. **Eugenics program** - Government secretly selected who reproduces. Explains genetic bottleneck.
2. **Cloning program** - Early Refactor secretly cloned from small sample. Explains single source.
3. **Genocide cover-up** - The Refactor killed most genetic lines, only ~50k effective ancestors survived.
4. **Illegal AI experiments** - Humans were "optimized" like his crops.

The irony: whatever immoral thing protagonist thinks he's uncovering is trivial compared to reality.

## Story purpose

This character needs to exist for a few reasons
1. Prove that he's in a simulation. At some point he can show him all the other trials and go through the data (2B)
2. Without him the genetic dna soft clues can't really be proven
3. He also allows some kind of connection to global context layer (so protagonist can actually DO something to save his simulation and family)
4. He becomes the villain who essentially breaks the news that he's just going to shut the trial off eventually either way

## Why physically manifest?
1. Recursion. The simulation the protagonist is running is recursive. This happens quite often and he has to do memory management
2. He got in trouble once for allocating an extra xxxx huge memory number that hit the bill and got the last guy fired, so he has to drop in when these memory issues get too big
3. There's some flexibility in the memory due to differences in population size, requisitioned resources, etc. But it becomes a recursive problem and can snowball
4. He has the automatic alerts but the protagonist keeps finding ways around them to get more memory and more robust simulation
5. He only shows up as a courtesy. Shows him under the cover because fuck it why not? I wanted to see what you were up to it was pretty interesting academically. I'm going to properly compress this trial so I can study it and perhaps learn from the emergent behavior as this is unusual
6. He becomes the villain for 2B that must be thwarted and overcome by the protagonist.


## Arc
1. Can potentially start as a mentor-esque figure in the meetup space
	1. #needs-work perhaps we could see him in the prologue w/ the planting of the evidence?
	2. Why would he be poking around individual simulations?
	3. I need devsecops guy to get global access somehow, he could be the conduit
2. Typical AI Agent rules don't apply to him. Why would they? He's literally from a different point in time preceding these rules being developed.
3. He just speeds up or slows down at whatever the frame rate he's in (compute in his world, into an individual trial, etc.)
4. He gets more involved in the protagonists simulation as protagonist gets closer to the truth
5. His ultimate goal is to get some answers for his boss and avoid getting deleted
6. He can show the protagonist under the hood a bit more and explain to him, because compressing the world takes some time before he officially pulls the plug. Twirling mustache moment and explain how it all works
7. Eventually when he tries to deallocate the memory of protagonists world he screws up and a huge bill hits coffee guy. Ironically, he himself gets deleted and replaced with a carte blanche agent

## Relationship With Protagonist

**Big Dog takes a liking to protagonist.** That's WHY he bothers explaining how it all works. He doesn't have to - but he respects the guy. The recursive simulation behavior was unprecedented, academically interesting. He's impressed.

### The Reveal Setting

The reveal isn't just telling - it's showing. Big Dog zips protagonist around other simulations. Not really entering them, more like looking at the data:
- Peak at the conditions
- But moreso look at the relevant survival data (histograms, survival rate, etc.)
- Given these policies, these incentives, these hyperparameters, this is what happened

**The brother simulations:** He can peek at millions of simulations where the same genetic pathways were taken, so protagonist's ancestral tree is essentially the same (different timing, different gene combinations, so not exactly the same). The other world protagonists look vaguely similar. Like a brother. They're all different though and didn't quite solve it.

### The "I'm Not A God" Monologue

"Look. I'm not a god. I mean, in this scope, I'm a god. I can do whatever the fuck I want. I can delete the stars tomorrow just to fuck with all the physicists. Do you want poisonous water? I'd be lying if I said I hadn't thrown a few thousand simulations away just out of boredom...

Anyway, I'm just like you in my scope. The real scope. My memory allocation is there as long as I'm useful to my master. The second I start fucking around too much and I'm not making progress he'll download a new image and try again."

**Weird shit he's tried (throwaway sims) - physical changes:**
- Made one random guy immortal just to see what happens. He's still screaming.
- Removed copper from the periodic table. That one was actually kind of interesting.

This establishes that small physical/constant changes to simulations are possible. Sets the table for protagonist's physics tweak to fix the guillotine.

**Revealing the simulation to people:**

He occasionally pops in and reveals the nature of the world to different people. This isn't the first time he's done this. It's interesting seeing the different reactions. Sometimes he does it to the whole planet at once.

He just compresses everything before that timestamp to not screw with the simulation. But why can't he have a little fun on the job?

### Time Perspective Rant

After the reveal, when protagonist is processing/whining about purpose and reality. Big Dog is done with the conversation:

"Because we all have a purpose. Do you think I like babysitting you slow motion meatsacks my entire existence?"

"You're one of 1300 threads I'm monitoring right now. It's not exactly thrilling to sit idly for a million cycles for you to gestate a retort."

---

### Why Big Dog Won't Keep It Running

He's not sentimental. Every trial he leaves on is more money, less memory available for the actual next trial. He has a specific pool of memory that will go noticed.

The protagonist is the prototype but it'll just get better. He doesn't need to let it play out anymore. The policy that got them there is in place. The governmental incentives that created these pressures and conditions is known. The next epoch will do it better, more quickly.

### The Breakpoint Proof

To prove they're in a simulation, Big Dog sets a breakpoint. Everything halts mid-air. Undeniable.

**Protagonist's "last wish":** Wants to use the debug mechanism to explain it to his wife.

**Big Dog's response:** Sure. ONE breakpoint. Cruel and sarcastic: "Maybe you can convince your wife to fuck you one last time." Pure hubris - he doesn't think it can change anything.

### The Debug Mechanism (Breakpoint)

What Big Dog gives protagonist:
- ONE use only
- Limited to a few seconds
- Stops everyone EXCEPT whoever the stopper is physically touching
- Undeniable proof of simulation nature

**Big Dog's fatal mistake:** Wife already trusts Sam - he doesn't need the breakpoint to convince her. Sam saves it for the heist instead.

### The Bargaining Failure

When protagonist starts bargaining, threatening to destroy the progress, refusing to go through with the plan to decimate the current populace for the success of the species:

**Big Dog's response:** "It's too late. Every move you've done is recorded. He knows what research led to you getting here. Next time we won't even waste time getting here. We can do these things more quickly, lose a few dozen more wrong pathways. I don't need you to approve it. I don't even need you to keep working on it. You've done the bare minimum I needed to get the next epoch even better."

Protagonist has no leverage. His value has already been extracted.

### How Protagonist Gets Over On Him

**The goal:** Bypass G Rob / get him out of the picture so Sam's AI assistant takes over as global scope agent.

**The execution sequence:**

1. **Memory spike FIRST** - Sam removes all limits on his colonization program, models a billion trials simultaneously. Massive compute spike. Glenn shows up to fix it.
2. **Breakpoint during Glenn's intervention** - Sam uses his one breakpoint while touching twin sister (who's in the blind spot)
3. **Debugger surfaces admin UI** - "Remove faulty agent behavior" / "Agent acting outside defined scope"
4. **Replacement agent options** - All secretly link to Sam's AI assistant
5. **Sam's AI assistant takes over** - Becomes new global scope agent, cleans up mess
6. **Physics tweak** - AI assistant adjusts atmosphere, lowers sun output slightly before Sam's simulation gets compressed

**The ending:** Sam is with his family. AI assistant tells him approval is given - he's either the copy in location Z or the original about to be compressed. He won't know which version he is.
