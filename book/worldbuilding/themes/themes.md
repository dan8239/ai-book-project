# Core Themes

## The Central Question

**"What are you optimizing for?"**

### Subquestions

- You can't optimize your way to meaning.
- All models are wrong, some are useful. You have to choose what matters in a model with care.
- Survival requires sacrifice, not optimization. You can't optimize everything — choosing what to give up is the real decision.
- Don't blindly trust the algorithm. Real life is not a model.
- The things that survive are the things no one is watching.
- Does a life have to matter to anyone else to matter?

### How the question echoes at every level

| Character/System | What they optimize for | What they miss |
|-----------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Sam | Legacy — his name remembered | His family, right in front of him |
| Glenn | Cost efficiency — budget, compression | Individual human lives have value |
| Coffee Guy | Results — trial success rates | 847M simulated deaths are real |
| Honeycomb | Species survival — macro policy | What "human" means after you warp it |
| The Mountain | Survival — day to day | — |
| Ramona | — | — |

## Supporting Themes

### Loss Functions as Ideology
What you optimize for determines what you become. Every society has a loss function, even if implicit.

### We Are All Snapshots in Time
No memory between iterations. Identity is fragile. The protagonist who chooses 'yes' is not the same as the 2,762,639 who chose 'no'.

### Recursive Optimization
Simulations within simulations. Each layer optimizing the previous. Turtles all the way up — is the optimization layer real?

### The Post-Human Solution

The colonization program "succeeds" — but what survives?

- Government policy: "Humans and their descendants survive"
- Protagonist's solution: Scale + flexibility. Warp biology to fit planets, not planets to fit biology.
- What lands on other worlds: Flora, fauna, humans — but morphed beyond recognition to survive target conditions
- Descended from us. Selected from our ecosystem. But hardly "us."

Is humanity "saved" if what survives isn't recognizably human?

## Metaphors

**Primary:** Polynesian waka (colony starter boat) — Project TWO as the canoe carrying seeds to new islands.

**Secondary:** Spaceship Earth — the planet as a vessel. (Less central, may find room for it.)

**The Fishbowl/Aquarium:** Opens and closes the book. Fish in a tank, observed but unaware. Humans in a simulation, observed but unaware.

**The Mountain vs. The Clouds:** Physical vs. abstract. Present vs. optimized.
