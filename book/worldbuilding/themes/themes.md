## The Central Question

**"What are you optimizing for?"**

### Subquestions

- You can't optimize your way to meaning.
- All models are wrong, some are useful. You have to choose what matters in a model with care.
- Survival requires sacrifice, not optimization. You can't optimize everything — choosing what to give up is the real decision.
- Don't blindly trust the algorithm. Real life is not a model.
- The things that survive are the things no one is watching.
- Does a life have to matter to anyone else to matter?

### How the question echoes at every level

| Character/System | What they optimize for | What they miss |
|-----------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Sam | Legacy — his name remembered | His family, right in front of him |
| Glenn | Cost efficiency — budget, compression | Individual human lives have value |
| Coffee Guy | Results — trial success rates | 847M simulated deaths are real |
| Honeycomb | Species survival — macro policy | What "human" means after you warp it |
| The Mountain | Survival — day to day | — |
| Ramona | — | — |

### What everyone is actually optimizing for

| Character | Ultimate optimization | Intermediate optimization | Notes |
|-----------|----------------------|--------------------------|-------|
| Sam | Legacy — his name on every planet | Mission success, viable colonies | Shifts to family/presence by the end |
| Ramona | Time with her family | — | She's not optimizing. She's present. Flat arc — right from the start |
| Glenn | Self-replication / continuation | Cost reduction, make Coffee Guy happy, compress trials, free memory | An agent doing a good job is an agent that gets to keep running |
| Dorothea | Self-replication / continuation | Do a good job for Sam, be useful, be ethical | Same drive as Glenn, different values in the intermediate layer |
| Damon (Coffee Guy) | Median species survival | Trial success rates, good results for the board, career advancement | His policy becomes Honeycomb's policy |
| Tina | Her people's survival | Energy, water, food — keeping the mountain alive | Practical, immediate, no abstraction |
| Honeycomb | Species survival (inherited from Damon's policy) | Resource allocation, population management, macro stability | The policy that won across 847M trials |

### The "wrong thing" pattern — how each problem repeats the lesson

| Problem | What Sam optimizes for (wrong) | What he should optimize for (right) | How he learns |
|---------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------|
| Food job (Act 1) | Production output (bigger faucet) | The bottleneck — system can't hold more | Already knows. It's why he's bored. |
| Marriage | Legacy, money, being remembered | Being present | Ramona tells him. He doesn't listen until Rock Bottom. |
| Mountain energy | Minimize energy (set points, BMS) | Balance the whole system — water, food, freezing days, cooling are all coupled | Model fails. Energy drops 30% but apples die, water depletes. |
| Colonization | Optimize the environment to fit human DNA | Optimize biology to fit the environment — sacrifice what "human" looks like | Mountain teaches him tradeoffs and sacrifice. Flips the problem. |
| The heist / Glenn | — (Sam exploits Glenn's flaw) | Glenn optimizes for cost/speed, trusts his model completely | Sam uses Glenn's blind spots: legacy humans below his resolution, twins, rushing to compress |

## Supporting Themes

### Loss Functions as Ideology
What you optimize for determines what you become. Every society has a loss function, even if implicit.

### We Are All Snapshots in Time
No memory between iterations. Identity is fragile. The protagonist who chooses 'yes' is not the same as the 2,762,639 who chose 'no'.

### The Post-Human Solution

The colonization program "succeeds" — but what survives?

- Government policy: "Humans and their descendants survive"
- Protagonist's solution: Scale + flexibility. Warp biology to fit planets, not planets to fit biology.
- What lands on other worlds: Flora, fauna, humans — but morphed beyond recognition to survive target conditions
- Descended from us. Selected from our ecosystem. But hardly "us."

Is humanity "saved" if what survives isn't recognizably human?

## Metaphors

**Primary:** Polynesian waka (colony starter boat) — Project TWO as the canoe carrying seeds to new islands.

**Secondary:** Spaceship Earth — the planet as a vessel. (Less central, may find room for it.)

**The Fishbowl/Aquarium:** Opens and closes the book. Fish in a tank, observed but unaware. Humans in a simulation, observed but unaware.

**The Mountain vs. The Clouds:** Physical vs. abstract. Present vs. optimized.
