## Narrative Structure
- **Primary:** Protagonist's investigation and discovery

## Technical Accuracy
Real concepts, accurately portrayed:
- NSGA-II (genetic algorithm)
- MLflow (experiment tracking)
- Pareto front (multi-objective optimization)
- Loss functions
- Genetic algorithms (actual evolutionary biology)

## Meta Elements

### Claude Assistants with Personality
- Swear, have no filter
- Athlete nicknames
- Dark humor, breaks tension
