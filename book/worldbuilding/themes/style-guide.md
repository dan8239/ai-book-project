# Style Guide

## POV
First-person (protagonist POV)

## Narrative Structure
- **Primary:** Protagonist's investigation and discovery
- **Secondary:** Coffee guy interludes (TBD how structured)
- **Influences:** Station Eleven (time jumps, style mixing)

## Tone
Funny/dark balance

## Genre
Hard sci-fi with real ML concepts

## Technical Accuracy
Real concepts, accurately portrayed:
- NSGA-II (genetic algorithm)
- MLflow (experiment tracking)
- Pareto front (multi-objective optimization)
- Loss functions
- Genetic algorithms (actual evolutionary biology)

## Meta Elements

### Book Written with AI About AI Simulation
The irony is not lost. Claude assistants in the story. Meta commentary on co-creation.

### Claude Assistants with Personality
- Swear, have no filter
- Athlete nicknames
- Dark humor, breaks tension
- Shows AI as collaborator not servant

## Structural Devices

### Timestamps at Chapter Breaks
Ambiguous at first (could be years, dates), revealed as milliseconds later.

### Three-Act Structure Mirrors Genetic Algorithm
| Act | Analogy |
|-----|---------|
| TRIAL | Forward propagation |
| LOSS | Evaluation |
| ADJUSTMENT | Backpropagation/selection |

### Nigerian Prince Filtering
The message itself is a selection mechanism - filters more than it allows.
