## The Arc

| Era | What Happened |
|-----|---------------|
| 1890s | Mining boomtown (copper, silver, gold) |
| 1897 | First ski competition in Canada - Norwegian mining engineer |
| 1900s-2000s | Premier ski destination, "next Aspen" vibes |
| 2050s-2100s | Snow becomes unreliable, AI metals rush reopens mines briefly (Mo, W, Cu) |
| 2150s | Mines exhausted, ski industry dead, population crashes |
| 2225 | Quiet mountain town, wellness retreats, rehab centers, rewilding projects |

## The Town Now (2225)

### Feel

Once luxurious. Now faded. The bones of wealth are still visible - grand lodges converted to rehab facilities, ski chalets now wellness retreats, old restaurants serving the handful of tourists who come for "authentic mountain experience."

The people who stay are either:
- Running the retreats/rehab centers
- Remote workers (like Sam) who like the isolation
- Old families who never left
- Legacy humans passing as above

### What's Still There

- Gondola (runs for hikers, maintained)
- Old ski village architecture (repurposed)
- Trail systems (former ski runs, now hiking/running)
- Solar and wind infrastructure (from ski resort era, mostly off-grid now)
- A few restaurants, a grocery, medical clinic
- Metaverse connectivity (the clouds are the real economy)

### What's Gone

- Snow
- Crowds
- Most businesses
- The energy
- The money (mostly)

## Sam's Connection

- **From here.** Grew up in Rossland.
- **Works remotely.** Lives in the clouds (metaverse), barely engages with physical world.
- **Met Ramona here.** She's from the legacy human settlement nearby. The H₂S incident forced her above-ground, she ended up in Rossland for medical care, they met.
- **Still lives here.** Raises family here. Close to her family (the settlement), far from everything else.

## The Gondola Ride

### What Sam Sees Going Up

| Elevation | Then (Historical) | Now (2225) |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| Base (1,400m) | Ski village, lodges, crowds | Quiet wellness center, few staff, rehab patients on walks |
| Mid-mountain (1,800m) | Ski runs through dense forest | Dead/dying conifers, beetle-kill grey, second-growth scrub |
| Treeline (2,200m) | Snow line started here | Exposed rock, alpine scrub that used to be 500km south |
| Summit (2,600m) | Deep snow, wind-sculpted cornices | Bare rock, lichen, old equipment, views for 100km |

### Sensory Details

- Cable creaks differently than old footage shows (less ice load, different harmonics)
- Views are "better" - less cloud cover, clearer air - but it feels wrong
- Old ski lift towers on adjacent ridges, rusted cables still hanging, never removed
- Gondola cars refurbished but the originals had ski racks, boot warmers
- At summit, wind turbines disguised as old mining headframes
- Rock exposed that hasn't seen sun in 10,000 years, pale and unweathered

### The Ecosystem Shift

- Treeline moved up 400m
- Species from 500km south now dominate (different birds, different plants)
- No snow even at summit, even in "winter"
- Old avalanche chutes now just rock slides
- Glacial cirques empty, just talus
- Streams that used to be meltwater-fed now intermittent

## Why This Location Works (For Legacy Humans)

- Remote enough: nearest major city (Nelson) is 45 min drive
- Plausible history: mining + ski = explains all infrastructure
- Grid connection: power lines exist from ski era, can siphon
- Sam's presence: he lives here, hiking is normal, no suspicion
- Ramona's presence: she's FROM the settlement, visiting family is expected
- Altitude: above H₂S-affected lowlands

## Contrast: Sam's Two Worlds

| The Clouds (Metaverse) | The Mountain (Physical) |
|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Where he works | Where he lives |
| Infinite, abstract | Finite, decaying |
| Optimizing colonization | Barely noticing his town |
| Future-focused | Past-haunted |
| Clean, efficient | Messy, real |

He lives in one of the most interesting physical places on Earth - and he barely sees it. He's always in the clouds. The irony: the legacy humans 500m below him are more present in the physical world than he is.
