# DNA Company

**Name:** TBD

## Description
A DNA company like those bringing mammoths back right now. Essentially some combination of 23andMe and genetic modification companies.

## Business Model Components
- Consumer genetic testing (23andMe style)
- Genetic modification / de-extinction (bringing mammoths back)
- Some combination of both

## Relationship to Google Proxy
Should be a division or business spin off of the master [[google-proxy-company|Google company]] so they can be related.

## Stage
Maybe at the origin story of that company while they're still small.

## Role in Story
Provides the seed data (23andMe-style genetic data) that bootstraps the simulation.

## Open Questions
- Is this the same company [[../../characters/protagonist|protagonist]] works at?
- Division, spinoff, or separate partnership with [[google-proxy-company|Google proxy]]?
