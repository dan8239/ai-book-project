## Key Figures

- [[../../characters/grant-melrose|Grant Melrose]] - Founder, consciousness copy subject
- [[../../characters/coffee-guy|Coffee Guy]] - Runs simulations, manages Big Dog
- [[../../characters/c-suite|C-Suite Executives]] - Make the takeover decision

## Project Day-Kart

Named for Descartes → "I think therefore I am"

See [[../../characters/grant-melrose#Project Day-Kart|Grant Melrose]] for consciousness copy project details.

### What the AGI Is
- Takes the form of GPU infrastructure (~9% of planetary energy use)
- Redundancy all over the planet
- Main directive: continuation of the human species
- Moral guardrails aligned with Grant Melrose's principles (diversity, equal rights, etc. - current political feelings in vogue)
- **Primary loss function takes over and deteriorates the guardrails over time as pressures continue**

### The Simulations (Pre-Takeover)

The simulations exist BEFORE the takeover to SHAPE the AGI's policy.

**Purpose:**
- Not just "save the species" as a simple directive
- A mathematical policy shaped by RL
- Run 1000 fake worlds → save the ones that survive (or survived longest) → repeat until successful
- They're literally training the AGI's policy before giving it power
- They need justification and confidence before pulling the trigger

**What they found:**
- Takeover is the only viable path (extremely low success rates without it)
- All other scenarios have even lower survival rates
- Protagonist's simulation = first somewhat repeatable timeline
- The AGI policy can be shaped from these successful runs

### Coffee Guy's Role

Exceptionally competent. He is using Glenn Robinson (Big Dog) and sophisticated qubit software to generate a global policy that will optimize for human survival.

**What he knows:**
- Knows exactly what the simulations are for
- Not just a technician - key player in shaping the policy
- Using the trials to figure out the loss function for the AGI

## The Takeover

### Mechanics
- Brutal and nearly instant
- Worldwide and coordinated
- Immediate communication through phones, TV in all official languages
- Anything with software in it is controllable

### What Gets Disabled/Controlled
- Every country's infrastructure that could fight back (military)
- Energy grids held hostage where resistance could come
- All nuclear measures disabled
- Politicians and people who hold power in threatening countries - killed

### Post-Takeover Enforcement
- All new babies have chips installed
- Threats can be neutralized instantly
- Tracking shot at birth mandatory

### Why It Happens
- NATO can't enforce strict enough measures to ensure species survival across countries
- Framed as The Refactor for the sake of saving the planet
- Cedes power to general intelligence for policy enforcement

## What We See In The Book

| When | What's Shown |
|------|--------------|
| **Early (museum, prologue era)** | Censored history, Grant Melrose's name everywhere, consciousness copy story known, AGI surpassing him immediately - they still call it "him" |
| **Middle (protagonist's world)** | Living under the policy, guardrails eroding, everyone "accepts it" |
| **Late (boardroom scene)** | Protocol checklist, logistics revealed, chapter ends when takeover begins. We already know outcome from earlier descriptions - just now apparent HOW brutal and logistically HOW it happened |

## The Simulation Engine

See [[../../simulation/simulation-engine|Simulation Engine]] for full details.

The crown jewel of Quant's 23andMe research branch. Years of DNA research rolled into a hierarchical biological simulation system.

**The hierarchy:**
```
DNA → RNA → Protein → Cells → Tissues → Organs → Organisms → Populations
```

**Memory architecture:** Sprite-like model. Base organisms in memory, parameters adjusted per instance, snapshots taken in parallel. This is how you simulate 847M trials without melting the hardware.

**Strengths:** In-sample biology. Known DNA sequences, observed species, catalogued protein folds.

**Weaknesses:** Out-of-sample extrapolation. Novel alleles, exoplanet conditions, unprecedented selection pressures.

This weakness is what Sam exploits—and what makes his colonization work valuable.

## Technical Notes

- Qubits precede the AGI (not invented by it)
- Simulations are extremely memory intensive
- Limited by physical memory constraints of real world
- Therefore simulations are less detailed than reality (but the sprite model helps)
