# Memory Map Gadget

A household device — decorative frame/dashboard that displays family history.

## Physical Description

A gadget that's framey and decorative. Similar vibe to getting a nice espresso machine or a fancy framed photo of your family. The kind of thing that's touching and about your family. Sam gives it to his wife as a gift.

It's basically a geocoordinates map like the political map they do on the electoral college, where it can zoom in and out of different maps and grids and show you more data and information. It's basically an enormous dashboard, but it's about her past — both of their past travel, essentially their entire history as humans, where they've been at every minute.

## Data Structure

The granularity is:
- LatLong
- Timestamp
- HumanID

Linked to images from that time period and videos from that time period. It stores moments that were notable in your physio reaction at that moment — perhaps you were crying, perhaps adrenaline was pumping, perhaps you're extremely sad or exhausted. Just the extremes of your existence during those times relative to the other moments, your base health physio conditions.

## How It Works

### Automatic Capture

The data is just tracked. You're basically recording automatically — your device is recording your own moments that it can recall back. Like how Rivian collects crash information: it is getting the raw signal, converting it to image. They're taking the noise from retinal signal or whatever and using some kind of neural net, just mapping that directly to image storage that gets stored as an mp4 or whatever the better technology is.

This thing is just pulling from that raw captured information of that time. It captures as you go through life.

### Dynamic Playback

It generates an automatic video that splices up the nicest month of that trip in terms of images and videos. It real-time live edits a video, like your last year Google photos of Max or Miles, but it does it dynamically where:
- You zoom into that weekend and it shows you a flashback of that weekend
- You zoom in for the month and it will start playing like Netflix, like the trailer of that month in terms of the data capture, the images

It just shows you six videos spliced together where you get the actual human moment. That's three seconds long, but it's the peak moment of that video in terms of engagement and how good of a video it is. So it's all kid giggles and the first time they walk on something — just the best of the best moments.

### Mood Awareness

It can tell when you're feeling down. It knows to show you happy things and sad things. It basically monitors your mood and shows you the things that you need mentally to proceed properly in your life — whether you need a pick me up or a reminder of your past successes or you need a good cry or whatever. The mood thing changes throughout the character's moods switching.

## Story Functions

### Exposition Device
- Window into backstory
- Can fall on "10 years ago today" or something and show flashback content
- Means to show a little bit more about the life, expose some backstory about the characters
- Tell about the world and the technology that's available

### Worldbuilding Through Normalcy
Nobody finds this creepy at all. It's just touching. "Wow, that's really thoughtful actually." It just kind of auto plays in the background. Shows how much more access they have — it's not even that you elect in, this data is just tracked.

### Flashback Mechanism
Use sparingly — maybe once, maybe twice, don't overuse it. It's there for pulling you back in to scenes that are very at home or heavy, or you want to make a statement about something or a character's feelings at that time.

## Future Scene: Reading the Wife

*Save for later scene — not the birthday chapter.*

The protagonist doesn't even notice his wife's energy switch in how she's talking to him, but he sees that the images on the screen are pulling out mood indicators that he couldn't even pick up on. It's telling him how she feels about it. This bothers his wife — that he can't read it himself. He instinctively looks at this thing to read his own wife.

Basis for a scene during an argument or tense moment with the characters.

## Geography Display

The map is all hex — H3 grid coordinates. Everything is strictly named by grid. Instead of being "we were in Madrid, and then we went to Portugal," the map is just geocoordinate grids, hexagons, very exact numerical codes. They're basically just zip codes, but more exact.

Cities still have names, but when they use a map to chart out where they went, it just walks them through the coordinates. Shows how much more efficient things are. The fact that we don't call things countries anymore — we just call them what their grid is because there's no more countries.

Big cities might have a nickname or something, but don't give them all away.
