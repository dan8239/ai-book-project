# Heist Mechanism

## The Goal

Get above Glenn's scope to Coffee Guy's access pathway - base images, core company servers. Need to escape the trial/epoch layer entirely.

---

## The Mechanism

### Setup

1. **Big Dog gives Sam ONE breakpoint** - hubris and cruelty. Sarcastic: "maybe you can convince your wife to fuck you one last time"
2. **Wife already trusts Sam** - doesn't need the debugger to convince her
3. **Sam saves the breakpoint** - uses it for the heist instead
4. **Brother-in-law gets blackmailed** - "You will believe me. If you don't do this, I cut you off from X. If you do, I give you Y that removes your dependence on above-ground entirely."

### Breakpoint Rules

- Stops everyone except whoever the stopper is physically touching
- Limited to a few seconds

### Execution Sequence

1. **Memory spike FIRST** - triggers Glenn to show up and try to fix it
2. **Debugger triggers options** - surfaces UI for "remove faulty agent behavior" (acting outside defined scope)
3. **Replacement agent options appear** - all options secretly link to Sam's AI assistant
4. **Sam's AI assistant takes over** - cleans up the mess, spins down worlds
5. **Quick admin tweak** - adjusts atmosphere, lowers sun output slightly (the physics fix)

### The Ending

Sam is with his family. AI assistant tells him: "Approval given. Ready when you are. You'll either be in the compressed simulation about to die, or you'll be in the server - depending on whether you're the copy or the original."

He won't know which version of himself he is. He just has to live with that uncertainty.

## Component Details

### Memory Spike (Trigger)

**How Sam triggers it:**
- Removes all limits on his colonization program
- Models a billion trials simultaneously
- No constraints = massive compute
- Definitely getting fired for it (echoes Glenn's previous budget incident)

**Visual:** The entire perceptive frame rate of Sam and folks in heist literally slows down - compute is lagging.

**Result:** Glenn shows up to fix it.

### Glenn's Ancient Base Image + Known Vulnerability

Glenn is from early 2000s base image. Old software has known vulnerabilities.

**Use:** Sam exploits this during freeze to view memory / poke around OS for clues. Hacker/heist payoff.

#needs-work - Specific vulnerability TBD. Must combine with debugger and brother-in-law's role.

### Brother-in-Law's Crucial Role (The Blind Spot)

**The advantage:** Legacy humans don't have nanobots. The AGI monitors everyone through nanobot data collection. Outside of those systems = lot of work to detect.

**Foreshadowing:** Establish early that monitoring outside nanobot systems is expensive/difficult for AGI. Glenn doesn't bother with legacy humans because the cost isn't worth it.

**Brother-in-law's part:** #needs-work - Something he can do from the blind spot that Sam can't do while monitored. Perhaps part of the data Sam needs to see, or a timing coordination, or physically touching Sam during the breakpoint?

### The Debugger UI

During breakpoint, debugger surfaces administrative options:
- "Remove faulty agent behavior"
- "Agent acting outside defined scope"
- Links to replacement agent options
- All replacement options secretly route to Sam's AI assistant

### Sam's AI Assistant Takes Over

Becomes the new global scope agent. Generates a routine-looking cleanup task list for Coffee Guy to approve:

1. Pause process for simulation 120412 (Sam's simulation - find symbolic number)
2. Continue data compression algorithm
3. Deallocate memory for all unfinished simulations
4. Prune failed trials
5. Select simulations to include for RL retraining
6. Implement individual trial scope memory limitations to protect against this happening again
7. Generate full report of underlying cause of issue (emergent behavior) for superiors
8. Allocate and store memory in location Z

**The hidden payload:** Step 8 is where the copied simulation (with physics tweak applied) gets stored. Coffee Guy approves the whole list without scrutinizing - it looks like routine cleanup.

**Important:** Sam's original simulation is still being compressed. What survives is the copy in location Z.

## Foreshadowing Elements

1. Sam's colonization work being compute-intensive (established early)
2. Glenn's old base image (old school vibes, outdated protocols)
3. Big Dog's previous budget incident that got last guy fired
4. Monitoring outside nanobot systems is expensive/difficult
5. Legacy humans as blind spot Glenn doesn't bother with
6. Cost sensitivity throughout (autoscaling, resource allocation)

## Open Questions

1. **Specific known vulnerability?**
   - Must combine with debugger + brother-in-law's role
   - Early 2000s base image = what specific exploit?

2. **Brother-in-law's exact role?**
   - Blind spot advantage is clear
   - What specifically does he DO during the heist?
   - Is he physically present? Touching Sam during breakpoint?

3. **The blackmail terms?**
   - What does Sam threaten to cut off?
   - What does Sam offer that removes dependence on above-ground?

4. **Escalation details?**
   - "Remove all limits" = what specifically?
   - A billion trials of what exactly?
   - More to develop here eventually

## Rejected Ideas

- Energy channel exploit (wrong scope - within simulation only)
- Legacy humans as unmonitored compute (wrong scope)
- Net positive tolerance exploit (doesn't escape scope)
- Memory spike with legacy humans as backup (wrong scope understanding)
- Sam optimizes Glenn (doesn't escape scope)
