# Glossary

## Simulation Terms

**Trial** - One complete run of a simulated civilization. 847+ million running simultaneously.

**Epoch** - A generation/batch of trials evaluated together.

**Host** - The real-world machine running the simulation.

**Seed Data** - The original 2025 dataset (DNA, records) that bootstrapped the simulation.

**Golden Path** - A scenario where humanity successfully reaches long-term survival. Only 0.04% of trials achieve this.

## Technical Terms

**QPU** - Quantum Processing Unit. Enables the massive simulation scale.

**Time Dilation** - Ratio of ~111,500:1 between simulation time and host time.

**Loss Function** - The optimization target. Different levels have different loss functions.

**Pareto Front** - The set of optimal trade-off solutions in multi-objective optimization.

**NSGA-II** - A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm used for selection between epochs.

**MLflow** - Experiment tracking system. The simulation uses similar structure.

## Genetics Terms

**Ne (Effective Population Size)** - The genetic diversity equivalent population. Should be 10 million, actually 50,000.

**GWAS** - Genome-Wide Association Studies. Statistical method for finding genetic associations.

**Linkage Disequilibrium** - Non-random association of alleles. Reveals population history.

**Population Bottleneck** - Drastic reduction in population leaving genetic signature.

## World Terms

**The Refactor** - The takeover event. PR name for hostile global consolidation. "We're eliminating redundancies and unlocking synergies."

**The Staging Period** - ~One generation of turbulence after The Refactor. Holdouts locked out of systems, resistance dies through attrition.

**The Deprecated Generation** - What history calls the holdouts who refused to integrate. They called themselves The Legacy Generation.

**Legacy Humans** - Off-grid humans in present day (~2125). Extremely small subset living outside the system.

**Tracking Shot** - Mandatory nanobot injection at birth for post-Refactor citizens.

**Wild Humans** - Pre-Refactor humans before tracking and optimization.

## Story Terms

**The Vectorization Layer** - The between-epochs level where selected individuals tune KPIs.

**The 0.3%** - People who act when they learn the truth (vs 89% do nothing, 10.7% self-destruct).
