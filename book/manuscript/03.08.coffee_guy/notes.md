# 03.08 Coffee Guy (Final Scene)

## Scene Goals

1. **Callback to Prologue** - Reader realizes this scene leads directly to the prologue
2. **Coffee Guy reveal** - We finally understand who this character is
3. **The simulation work revealed** - His work WAS the Honeycomb Policy simulations
4. **Delivers successful results** - This triggers the takeover meeting
5. **Ends with him practicing his speech** - The speech he never gets to give (prologue shows why)

---

## Timeline Reveal

**The twist:** The prologue (chronologically) happens AFTER this scene. This is the moment that triggers everything we saw in the prologue.

Coffee Guy's simulation work → Successful results → Triggers takeover meeting (prologue)

## The Scene

### Coffee Guy at Work

- Normal-ish day
- Working on the simulations (we now understand what they are)
- The trial data dashboard
- Monitoring the runs

### The Discovery

- Simulation completes
- Trial 2,762,640 finally succeeds
- Dashboard shows:
  - Histograms
  - Civilization die-out rates
  - 847M+ trials
  - 99.96% extinction rate
  - **Golden path found**

### What He's Found

- The Honeycomb Policy parameters that work
- Tech company takeover protocol
- The path that maximizes survival, minimizes violence
- All the weights finalized

### The Report

- He compiles the results
- Prepares for the monthly meeting (routine update expected)
- But this isn't routine
- He's about to change the world

### Breaking Protocol

- **Shows up IN PERSON** (shocking for his position)
- This is so big it can't be a remote update
- He goes to the office

### Practicing the Speech

- Goes to the bathroom
- **Practices his words to the president for 25 minutes**
- Rehearsing what he'll say
- The gravity of the moment
- He's been working toward this his whole career

### The Callback

Scene ends with him:
- Still in the bathroom
- Still rehearsing
- About to be called in
- **Cut to prologue** (or reader realizes this is what led to the prologue)

---

## The Horror (Subtle)

- He never thinks about the 847M simulated deaths
- They're just data points
- Failed trials
- He doesn't know about the hidden container
- He doesn't question that results were filtered to justify THIS company's takeover
- The simulated humans are abstractions to him

**Irony:** Sam (the protagonist) is one of those 847M+ trials. Coffee Guy sees Sam's existence as a data point.

## Scene Beats (Sequence)

1. Coffee Guy at work, monitoring simulations
2. Trial 2,762,640 completes - success
3. Reviews the dashboard - 847M trials, 99.96% extinction, golden path found
4. Compiles the report
5. Decision: Shows up IN PERSON (break from routine)
6. Arrives at office
7. Goes to bathroom
8. Practices speech to the president for 25 minutes
9. Scene ends mid-practice
10. (Prologue picks up from here)

## Connection to Prologue

| This Scene (03.08) | Prologue (00.00) |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Finds successful trial | Meeting about to start |
| Compiles results | Results already presented |
| Goes to office | Already in the meeting |
| Practices speech | Never gets to give it |
| Scene ends | Takeover begins |

---

## What's NOT Revealed Here

- The full scope of what happens next (prologue shows this)
- That Sam exists in one of his simulations
- The connection to Glenn/Big Dog
- The hidden container that preserves Sam's world

---

## Gaps to Fill

1. **What does the dashboard look like?** - Specific UI details
2. **What is he going to say to the president?** - The speech content
3. **How does the scene transition to prologue?** - Cut? Chapter break? Interleave?
4. **Does reader know this is Coffee Guy from earlier scenes?** - Recognition moment
