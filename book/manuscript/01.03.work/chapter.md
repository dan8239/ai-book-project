# 01.03 Work

## Chapter Goals

- Introduce Sam's work environment
- Show the temp he's training to replace him
- Establish he's been on this contract too long and is ready to move on
- World exposition: how work functions in Honeycomb

## Scene Concept

The temp is who Sam is bringing on to replace him. Sam's been on this food chain optimization contract for way too long — originally 6 months, extended at-will. He's basically fulfilled it. He doesn't really need money. He's just had enough.

He's an at-will employee for the system at this point. Mostly thinking about taking some time. "I just don't need to work. I've got enough credits left. We could live for the rest of my life without it."

## World Exposition

This chapter should show:
- The typical career is much shorter now
- Nobody's grinding for 50 years anymore for work because most people don't have to work at all
- You're working for extra credits
- Your energy already takes care of life support, food, healthcare, education — all that is covered as part of your existence bill
- The only thing extra is what you electively use

## The Temp

See [[worldbuilding/characters/temp-trainee|Temp / Trainee]] for character details.

The temp is a statistical PhD. Exposition device for explaining the world state to the reader through Sam explaining things to them.
