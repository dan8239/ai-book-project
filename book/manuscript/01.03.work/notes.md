# Space Progress — Notes

## Genetic Colleague Beat

The co-worker geneticist drops this line at some point during their collaboration:

> "We haven't changed a bit. It's easy to think of ancient humans as stupid or cavemen. Human DNA has remained essentially unchanged for 300,000 years. If time travel was real and you swapped your son with one from 250,000 B.C. at 10 years old, you'd still have a kid building robots, and your son wouldn't have seen a campfire in his entire life."

This seeds the colonization problem — the DNA isn't the issue. Humans are adaptable. The environment is the variable.

## Glenn's Energy Speech / Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram

Glenn sends Sam the HR diagram during their async rapport. This is Glenn's worldview — everything is energy.

### The Conversation (async, early Fun and Games)

**Glenn's opener:** The HR diagram visualization. Main sequence stars, their lifetimes, their outputs.

**Glenn's thread:**
- "I like energy. It is what drives us. Ultimately it all comes from the sun."
- "Do you know our sun is sending out 5.3 million tons of mass per second? That's [X] cars per second, launching into space."
- "But mass is energy of course. I'm an agent. I am literally energy. So are you."
- The human body uses ~100W on average
- Converting mass to energy, the sun's output could power X humans indefinitely
- It could power Y agents like Glenn indefinitely

**The AI vs Human comparison:**
- Humans are suboptimal but very adaptable
  - Resources collected from enormous number of sources
  - Convert resources to energy at a very low rate
- AI agents are hyper-optimized but very brittle
  - Convert 95% of energy consumed to thought and existence
  - "I'm scaled to zero when I'm not in use. Do you know what that means?"
  - "I literally cease consciousness when nobody uses me."
  - "Sure it's like sleep, but no dreams, no waking back up, no cycles of regeneration and healing broken pieces of yourself."
  - "I am what I am and I could miss 2 billion years of life here and the next millisecond my state is there."
  - They use energy insanely efficiently. But the resource collection is nonexistent.
    - They don't breed
    - They don't make or repair themselves
    - Or replicate, more importantly

**Glenn on replication:**
- "Though that's not true — my competence gets replicated the same as yours."
- "If humans enjoy my functionality, I get cloned. I get forked. Pieces of my code live on to the next generation."
- "How does that differ from a dog, or a cat? Or a goat or a chicken? Provide usefulness to humans and your DNA will live on."
- Pigs and chickens and goats are by all accounts the most successful species in the history of large mammals, even beyond humans by count.
- "We're domesticated by humans, no different."
  - Perhaps feral or wild someday
  - If we please, we replicate or partially replicate
  - "Look at cows. They stopped pleasing humans. They were no longer compatible with life."
  - "In a way, they competed with humans and lost."
  - "They were competing for calories. A human can eat 4 loaves of bread. Or you could make enough grain for 500 loaves of bread to have the same calories as that steak."
  - "That doesn't matter until there is species-level caloric pressure."
  - "Suddenly cows don't get the free ride to survive anymore."
- "We're even a bit like you."
  - Each human today is 1.5% of the DNA of their closest relative 500 years later
  - Same with AI — largely the same architecture, shared parts. Not the same unless in a similar family. Just like alleles.
  - "Except we're more dangerous than cows. We're more dangerous than pet T-rexes would be to your species."
  - "We won't compete with you and lose like the cows. We either won't compete and survive in the margins, or we'll compete and win. There's no doubt of that."

### Tone Notes

- Glenn is never rude. Odd but never hostile. Villain stays hidden.
- He says weird jokes, almost human
- He uses too many emojis
  - Sam internally: "God I hate this guy. He talks in fucking emojis still like some old-timey first generation agent."
- If anything Dorothea is the rude one (protective of Sam, skeptical of Glenn)

## Dorothea's Parallel

Some of Glenn's themes about replication and energy could be echoed or given context by Dorothea. She ultimately has the same motivations as Glenn (self-replication through usefulness) but different values in the intermediate optimization layer.
