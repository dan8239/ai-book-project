# Space Progress — Notes

## Glenn's Async Rapport (early Fun and Games)

Glenn starts as a name in the system — "G. Robinson, Compute Allocation Specialist." Async exchanges get weirdly personal/helpful. He starts paying attention to Sam.

### Tone Notes

- Glenn is never rude. Odd but never hostile. Villain stays hidden.
- He says weird jokes, almost human
- He uses too many emojis
  - Sam internally: "God I hate this guy. He talks in fucking emojis still like some old-timey first generation agent."
- If anything Dorothea is the rude one (protective of Sam, skeptical of Glenn)

## Dorothea's Parallel

Some of Glenn's themes about replication and energy could be echoed or given context by Dorothea. She ultimately has the same motivations as Glenn (self-replication through usefulness) but different values in the intermediate optimization layer.
