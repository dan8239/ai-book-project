Sam followed Ramona down into the tunnel on steel grated steps. The clang from their steps amplified into the darkness, making an odd, echoing song. At the bottom, metal stairs gave way to gravel. The small crunch of their feet changed the key of their tune that was reverberating through the mountain. The path was illuminated before them for a few dozen paces. The tunnel was carved straight into the rock in a perfect circle, descending slightly as it faded into utter darkness.

Ramona checked her wrist as if she were wearing a watch, then flexed her fingers and rubbed the skin where one might have been worn. She breathed in deeply through her nose with her eyes closed, squeezed Sam's hand then took off down the tunnel as she exhaled. "Not far now."

All along the perimeter of the tunnel was what looked like mesh netting, stapled into place every few meters. The air surprisingly wasn't stale—a steady flow of air was at their backs. The tunnel had a chalky, damp smell. 

They didn't venture far into the darkness before occupancy sensors triggered lighs further down their path. They walked for a long time in silence, Ramona occasionally checking her little treasure map as the tunnel branched and forked. They ignored any door that wasn't on Ramona's map. The right direction was nearly always further down, and further in.

After what must have been ten minutes, the circular, subtly curved tunnel gave way to a squat, square room. There was a flickering light at the far end. Racks were installed floor to ceiling in aisles, only interrupted by load bearing pillars of rock which must have remained while the rest of the room was carved out around them. The racks were filled with clear bins, pressure sealed from the top down, stacked, and labeled. Bin after bin of potatoes, yams, rice, roots, beans, corns, seeds, flour. They walked to the far end.

Ramona frowned at her map as she tried the handles on the double doors to no avail. "There's no further instr—"

"BOO!" A masked figure emerged from a nearby pillar and lunged at Sam with its hands up, and he stumbled back into a nearby pillar squealing. Ramona flinched as well, instinctively positioning herself between Sam and the figure with raised fists. Then Sam heard Ramona's somewhat muffled laugh and his fear gave way to confusion. But it wasn't Ramona laughing, it was the figure, pulling up a gas mask to reveal a smiling, friendly face.

"I almost knocked your teeth into your tonsils," grumbled Ramona as she gave her older sister a long hug. 
"Still would've been worth it! I hope you didn't shit yourself, Sam!" replied Tina, wiping a tear from the corner of her eye as she attempted to stop laughing.
"Do you store any underwear in these racks?" reposted Sam, weakly, as he stood. He waited his turn for a hug, brushing dust off of the back of his pants.

Tina was like a recording of her sister except with contrast turned all the way down on her skin color. She was so pale it was almost translucent, with no other noticeable differences in their facial features. She wore French braids down just past her shoulders. Her long sleeved cotton button-down shirt was form fitting, with old jeans and composite-toe boots. She wore a watch on her wrist and a small pack on her back.

Sam shuffled as his turn still hadn't arrived. Ramona's shoulders heaved slightly, and Tina finally pulled away to stuff her mask back in her bag.
"I can't thank you enough for this." She finally gave Sam his hug.
"It was nothing. Ramona did most of the arrangements, anyway. Thanks for letting me tag along." He pulled away, a bit stiffly.
"No, really." Her blue eyes met his for a beat as her hands lingered on his shoulders. He broke eye contact first, turning to his wife.
"So, can we get the tour?"

Tina walked over to the flickering light and fiddled with it to somehow stop the flickering. Then she turned back to Sam and Ramona, smiled politely, and lifted her wrist to the door. When she heard the solenoid unlock she leaned against the panic bar, swung the door open, and gave an exaggerated flourish to show the way to her guests.

They emerged into an expansive atrium. A walkway surrounded a roughly circular courtyard at the center, too large to see fully across. An enormous domed ceiling was overhead, providing the illusion of daylight. A black hole opened in the center. A steel lattice gave support from the dome down into the open courtyard. Cables hung down between the steel grid, distributed evenly between them. Enormous grey cubes hung on some of the cables, level with the walkway they stood on. They were bigger than his apartment. 

As he approached the clear guardrail, he felt an enormous updraft, strong enough to whip his hair out of place. The pit sunk into the void, a seemingly bottomless abyss. There were more of the cubes below their current level, randomly spaced, like a frozen stone waterfall. Though, he noticed it wasn't totally frozen after all. He saw a few of the cubes descending almost imperceptibly downward in perfect sync. He estimated about ten percent of the wires had blocks on the top level. Twenty percent or so were visible somewhere further down the pit. The remainder was nowhere to be seen.

"I missed this smell." said Ramona softly, breathing in deeply as she leaned over the railing. She re-tied a strand of hair that had come loose from her pony.
"How many..." Sam trailed off.
"Let's get you home," said Tina, guiding her sister from the edge around the walkway towards a bank of clear elevators.

Sam followed but kept his gaze at the stone waterfall. He couldn't make out the far side of the pit, but from what he could see the mountain was bustling. Workers dressed like Tina had a few of the stone block cables locked out of service and were working where the cable anchored to the support beams. Further down a few floors a walkway was closed where some more workers were controlling a robot remotely. It scaled the wall, probing, adjusting, and ultimately grinding rock away, impossibly loud. The rock melted off the wall down a corkscrew hose into the basket of a very squat bulldozer. A few more walked casually on the steel lattice without so much as a safety harness or guardrail, and he could see there were man-sized gaps providing easy passage through each joint. He saw a couple eating lunch, seemingly on break together with their legs dangling over the side of a steel beam.

Lining the stone waterfall on down each side for innumerable levels was a mix of walkways and floor-to-ceiling windows for what appeared to be living quarters. Floor after floor of windows, like a a skyscraper had been unfurled and wrapped outside-in around the gaping donut hole in the mountain.

They took the first elevator that came, which gave a perfect view of the old mine shaft.  He people-watched floor after floor. Some had blinds closed and he could only see silhouetted shapes behind, others were more voyeuristic. As they descended he saw people working at terminals, lifting weights, running, sleeping, fucking. They kept moving down. His ears popped and he realized he'd been missing out on a conversation between Tina and Ramona.

"It would be nice to see him first. I'm not sure if I'm ready to go back to our chamber quite yet." Ramona mentioned to her sister.

Tina illuminated L86, and deselected L174 further below. He noticed the levels went top to bottom from 27 to 0, then L1 down to L218. He felt stupid not having checked the floor they came in on. Another worker came into the elevator on L80, selected L101, and greeted Ramona. Then he glanced at Sam and Tina and became visibly confused. 

They disembarked on L86 into an offensively white room, very well lit. The ceiling was 10 meters high or so, like 3 regular levels. The sound of running water was everywhere, seemingly in the walls. The earth smell was overwhelming. Floor to ceiling were crops, growing out of pockmarked PVC pipe, stepped like ladders vertically. The ends of the PVC had various smaller pipes and valves on the ends. Between the racks were people on lifts working with the plants on various levels. The lifts hung from gimbals on the ceilings that moved smoothly between the racks.

Tina grabbed a strawberry from one of the riper looking plants at eye level and promptly was scolded by someone on a lift further down the aisle. She yelled "Fuck off, Tim!", then grabbed a few more and passed them out to Sam and Ramona.

They walked through room after room on the floor, starting a lap around the central shaft. Eventually, when they were about a quarter of the way around the racks gave way to the same set-up, but with trees. Instead of dozens of tightly spaced levels of piping, there were just two levels here. A ground level with rows of pear trees, then a shelf above those trees with a second layer. Lights from the bottom of the top shelf illuminated the trees on the bottom, while water dripped down through all levels. Every few aisles there was a physical barrier keeping sections physically isolated from one another.

They hopped on a free lift together and Tina entered 16F-2 into the interface. The glided, up to the 2nd level, then into the stacks, whipping past countless trees. Each row had trees at varying stages of production. There were young trees and old in each row. Some aisles had blossoms, others had small buds developing. Some had huge, ripe apples. Rotting apples were everywhere on the soil at the bases of those trees. There were trees losing their leaves. There were leafless, dormant trees covered in artificially created snow. Eventually they made it to an apple tree nearly 5m high, covered in apples ready for picking. A small granite cross was being swallowed up by the roots of the tree, which seemingly grew around the stone. She noticed that 3 out of every 10 trees had a small headstone in a similar place.

Ramona talked a lot about her dad, but always as though he were still around. In 9 years of marriage she'd never confided in him how he'd passed. He suspected it had something to do with her leaving the Mountain, but figured she'd tell him when she was ready.

Sam waited as long as he possibly could. After a few minutes, he tried to break the ice.
"Why bother with the snow? Why not just have them grow all year?" Sam asked Tina.
"Because—" Tina and Ramona paused as they figured out who would defer to the other. Eventually Ramona spoke.
"Apples, pears, cherries, peaches... a lot of plants need a month or so of freezing temperature or they won't produce fruit. We don't have nearly as many chill rooms as we used to, though. Less each year."
"How do you not know that? Aren't you some hotshot food supply chain guy?" puzzled Tina.
Sam was a bit embarrassed. "I mean, not anymore. I don't know. I guess I never really got into the weeds on the process. I just work with probabilities and optimizing under uncertainty. I don't really know the process all of the time. I'd guess you're using roughly 1000 liters of water and about 9 grams of nitrogen per year for the same area. You're looking at about 2700 hours of light per year, 800 kWh to run those lights on a day/night cycle. I'd say you should be getting about 2500 kcal per square meter per year for what you put into it. I couldn't tell you the first thing about actually growing them though."
Tina plucked the three choicest apples from the tree and distributed them.
"How did you manage to impregnate Mona thrice just reading about fucking?"
"Tina!" Ramona gave her sister a Charlie horse in the shoulder.

Tina's radio crackled.
"*Sparky Two you there?*"
"Copy, go ahead"
"Need you in the control room, Chief is looking for you."
"En route, be there in 5"
