# 02.02 First Contact

## Scene Goals

1. **Scale reveal** - Legacy human civilization is far bigger than Sam thought (more people under this mountain than in the city above, ~10,000)
2. **World reveal** - How legacy humans live, their technology constraints, their attitude toward "larvae" above
3. **Emotional reunion** - Ramona and Tina together for first time in 20 years
4. **Father's grave** - Ramona visits the apple tree, processes grief

## The Descent

### The Tunnel Structure

**Shape and Scale:**
- ~2.5 meter diameter, circular (reinforces the boring worm aesthetic)
- This is the residential entrance—just a people walkway, not freight
- Steel catwalk on the bottom, 3-4 feet wide (can walk side by side but clearly single-file intended)
- Smooth curves throughout (no elbows)—everything gently turns
- Subtle gradient descending the whole way

**Wall Construction:**
- Wire mesh netting covering exposed rock
- Steel rods hammered into rock like staples, holding mesh in place
- Transitions to concrete spray the further in it gets

**Infrastructure:**
- Conduit running for lights (minimal)
- PVC piping running through holes near the ceiling, forking with the path
- French drains / water collection underneath the catwalk (no water sounds yet)
- Occasional junctions—forks, stairs going down, locked doors to empty rooms

**The Walkway:**
- Steel grid catwalk
- Occupancy lights illuminate ~15 feet ahead, turn off behind
- Feels like being led

### Sensory Details

**Sound:**
- Footsteps echo for an insane amount of time
- Eerily silent otherwise
- Later: Sound of water (aquaponics, drainage)
- Later: Sound of fans (ventilation)
- Occasional electrical buzz (not constant)

**Air:**
- Stagnant at first
- Then a breeze at his back, sucking toward where they're going
- Air quality: on walkway = whatever's outside; deeper in = perfect

## The Checkpoint / Meeting Tina

### The Checkpoint Room

**Physical Space:**
- Squat room with pillars (carved out square, but rock pillars left in a grid for support)
- French drains at edges—everything gently slopes toward walls
- Security gates, access codes
- Feels like an entry/exit checkpoint (think going through Cook County security)
- Racks floor to ceiling with clear bins—potatoes, yams, rice, roots, beans, corns, seeds, flour

**Mood:**
- Sam realizes this goes way deeper than Ramona's immediate ~15-20 person family unit
- The scale hints at the population reveal to come

### Meeting Tina

**The Entrance:**
- Tina jumps out from behind a pillar and scares the shit out of them
- Good sense of humor, especially with her sister
- First contact with Tina before the intake meeting

**Sam and Tina's History:**
- They've met a few times before (can't be married 10 years without meeting the close twin sister)
- Contact between Tina and Ramona has been more regular than Sam realized
- This is Sam's first time underground

**The Sisters' Reunion:**
- Ramona is emotional—wiping tears, so happy to see her
- Hugging, looking at each other
- Noticing changes (hair, etc.)
- Tina matches her energy—they're close, this is a real reunion

**Sam and Tina:**
- Tina is colder toward Sam
- Polite but guarded—Sam is an outsider here
- "I can't thank you enough for this" - genuine gratitude for the museum scheme

## The Gravity Battery (Main Chamber)

### The Reveal

They pass through what looked like a rock face (opens as an enormous slab). Walk out onto a small overhang platform.

**No Safety Fencing:**
- Literally no safety fencing anywhere in this place
- "We don't need stupid around here."

### Scale

- Football fields wide
- Can't see to the other side
- World's largest Rubik's Cube made of concrete

**The Shape:**
- Old mine shaft, widened over time
- Generally circular but organic - blocks form-fit to available space
- Not perfectly geometric - follows the natural contours of the excavation

**The Blocks:**
- Concrete-ish cubes on steel runners/wires (actually denser material than concrete)
- Random ones at top, can't see bottom
- No discernible pattern - looks like noise
- ~1 in 10 blocks at top (most are down = discharged)

**The Structure:**
- Insane steel framework at top
- Looks like the Sistine Chapel - perfect dome giving way to a black hole at the top
- Strong updraft
- Megamodule design - giant Willis Tower with grids
- Blocks go down between the tic-tac-toe lattice
- Maintenance folks walking on the struts, no safety stuff

**The Floors (Key Detail):**
- Flat levels with spiral stair access at same spots on each side
- Each level is glass-windowed like the side of an office building
- Can look in and see people working
- Some have blinds closed
- Lights on some, not others
- Christmas lights hanging in a few
- People are clearly **living** here - huge population

**Activity:**
- **Bustling** - construction crews everywhere
- Workers on scaffolding carving out more width
- Robotic/mechanical mining equipment strapped to the walls, grinding blocks out of stone
- Guys nearby commanding it with walkie-talkies
- Some blocks out of service for maintenance

### Sam's Observations (Mental Math Starts Here)

Sam is silently taking in:
- Number of floors
- Number of dwelling units
- Block positions (~10-12% at top = discharged)
- Workers adding capacity (they're short)
- Signs of energy conservation (lights dimmed, equipment idle, people walking instead of movers)

## The Elevator Down

### What Sam Sees

- Glass doors, can see everything
- People-watching floor after floor
- Blinds closed, silhouettes, voyeuristic glimpses
- People working at terminals, lifting weights, running, sleeping, fucking

### The Optical Illusion

- One of the blocks that was descending **stops**
- Then **starts rising again** - slowly, more slowly than Sam is descending
- Sam isn't sure if he's imagining it - optical illusion of him going down while that one goes up
- None of the other blocks seem to be moving
- The elevator going down = power draw = block rises to compensate

**Sam realizes:** The whole system is live, responding in real-time to every load.

### Floor Numbers

- Levels go top to bottom from 27 to 0, then L1 down to L218
- They came in somewhere in the upper levels

---

## The Orchard / Father's Grave

### L86 - The Growing Floors

- Offensively white room, very well lit
- Ceiling 10 meters high (like 3 regular levels)
- Sound of running water everywhere, seemingly in the walls
- Earth smell overwhelming
- Floor to ceiling crops in pockmarked PVC pipe, stepped like ladders
- People on lifts working the plants

### The Apple Orchard

- Quarter way around the shaft
- Two levels of trees instead of dense piping
- Ground level with pear trees, shelf above with second layer
- Lights from bottom shelf illuminate bottom trees
- Water drips through all levels
- Physical barriers every few aisles (isolation)

### Father's Tree

Nearly 5m high apple tree, covered in ripe apples. Small granite cross being swallowed by roots.

**Headstone:**
> *Franklin Ross Spencer*
> 2137-2178
> *Behind every breath, his hand*

3 out of every 10 trees have small headstones in similar places.

### The Chill Room Conversation

Sam asks why bother with the snow (artificial freezing for dormant trees).

Ramona explains: Apples, pears, cherries, peaches need a month of freezing or they won't produce fruit. They don't have as many chill rooms as they used to—less each year.

Sam's response reveals his optimization mindset—he knows the inputs (water, nitrogen, light, kWh) but not the process.

Tina: "How did you manage to impregnate Mona thrice just reading about fucking?"

### Radio Call

Tina's radio crackles:
> "*Sparky Two you there?*"
> "Copy, go ahead"
> "Need you in the control room, Chief is looking for you."
> "En route, be there in 5"

**Chapter ends here. Continues in 02.03 Control Room.**

## TODO: Ramona's Reaction to Sam's Real Motive

### Problem
The current prose has Sam as a wide-eyed tourist — impressed, doing mental math, following Ramona's lead. But per the outline, Sam agreed to this visit because he needs legacy human DNA for his colonization work. He traded optimization help for DNA access. Ramona brought him here to see her sister and her father's grave. These are fundamentally different reasons to be in the same place.

### What needs to happen in this chapter
Ramona discovers (or begins to suspect) that Sam didn't come for her. The Chief shakes Sam down for more input power. Sam pivots: "Give me 2 weeks and I'll quadruple your energy without exposing you." In return he wants their multi-generational closed-system data — agricultural records, population records, energy inputs, failure points. Ramona realizes this isn't the family visit she thought it was. He turned her homecoming into a business trip.

### Possible beats
1. **The deal scene (with the Chief):** Chief was going to strong-arm Sam for more power anyway — this isn't a surprise negotiation, it's mutual opportunism. Sam pivots from tourist to negotiator. Ramona watches him work and initially feels proud — he's impressive. Then she hears what he's asking for (their survival data, failure logs, everything they've learned keeping 10,000 people alive underground) and realizes this was his plan all along.
2. **The confrontation:** Doesn't need to be explosive here. A cold look. A quiet "You knew you were going to do this before we got on the gondola." Sam tries to justify — "I can help them AND get what I need." She's not wrong and he's not wrong, but the betrayal is in the lie of omission.
3. **The fallout carries forward:** She doesn't leave. She stays because this is her sister, her father's grave, her home. But the warmth from the gondola is gone. Sam got what he came for. She didn't.

### Tone
This shouldn't be a screaming match. The gravity battery reveal, the orchard, the father's grave — those emotional beats should still land. But underneath them, Ramona is processing that her husband used her family as a means to an end. The anger is quiet and devastating, not loud. It's the same dynamic as the birthday dinner: he's present physically but absent in purpose.

7. **The gravity battery reveal** - No safety fencing, football fields wide, Rubik's cube of concrete
8. **Take in the scale** - Blocks, floors, workers, living spaces, Christmas lights
9. **Elevator down** - Glass walls, optical illusion with rising block, people-watching
10. **L86 orchard** - White room, crops, earth smell
11. **Father's tree** - Headstone, ripe apples, Ramona's grief
12. **Chill room conversation** - Sam's optimization mindset vs actual process
13. **Radio call** - "Sparky Two" - Chief needs them in control room
