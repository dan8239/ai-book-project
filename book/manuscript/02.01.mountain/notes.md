## The Trailhead

### Setup

- Sam complains about the gondola receipt
- Walk up to the lodge
- ~11 folks on this trip total
- Map at trailhead showing trails

### Automated Trail Guide

- Opt-in audio guide on your device
- "If you want to join this trail, opt-in at any time..."
- Estimated charge is **tiny** - basically just compute cost for running the audio
- Sites include: [various points of interest]
- Sam and Ramona opt-in, start the hike

### Other Hikers

- Brief colorful characters to show demographics
- Or just blob-faced background people
- Half will turn back at the harder second leg

---

## The Hike - First Leg

### The Nature Walk

- Trail guide audio interjects at notable artifacts
- Historical sites throughout
- Sam and Ramona paying attention at first

### Rossland History (Trail Guide Content)

**The Original Mining Era:**
- Look up real mining history of Rossland
- When it started, when it stopped
- One of many mining entrances on this mountain

**The Second Gold Rush:**
- Rare earth elements discovered (critical for energy infrastructure)
- Battery materials, solar materials, whatever limits NVIDIA-type tech
- Deposits found here → reactivated mine
- Needs a fancy name for this era

**What They See:**
- Closed mine shafts
- Old robotic mining equipment / automated harvesters
- **The Boring Machine** - enormous piece of equipment
	- About 30M diameter
  - Like a TBM (tunnel boring machine) but omnidirectional/vertical
  - Diamond edges on the drill bits have been removed by looters a few hundred years back
  - Designed to bore through mountain with minimal human interaction
  - Sitting on tracks into the mountain
  - screw conveyor. It installs pre-cast concrete behind it to support the tunnel as it goes
  - walkway along the side of it
  - It's like modern ones but with joints so it could worm
  - Has ways to position itself vertically, anchor to surroundings
  - "Please do not climb on the structure"
  - This is how the mountain got hollowed out
  - Giant wheels on the side that can extend
  - Enormous rotating disc on the mouth end
  - It has precision drill cores for injecting precision explosives in the event that it was more energy efficient to blast things that way
  - This thing automatically analyzes the geological structure of rock faces before determining safest and most energy efficient strategy, then blasting
  - How many tons per year could it remove?
	  - 35m per week
	  - Sam does the math in his head
	  - That's x per year
- Old train car - "last train that ran on this line in [year]"
  - Just sitting there, still maintained
- Shaft sinking machine
  - Old shaft. Hear the air rushing back up at them then an enormous bang. Followed by the sound actually increasing

**Views:**
- View of Rossland from the peak
- Ghost towns on the mountain
  - Dilapidated buildings where miners lived
  - Small temporary establishments
  - Mining camp remnants

### The Plastic Dump

- Garbage pile still festering on the mountain
- All plastic - no biodegradation
- Trail audio: "Even small temporary establishments can generate significant waste..."
- Fact about garbage density per human
- "Given the duration from oldest to newest garbage, the layers, and the volume, researchers can estimate the number of settlers during that time"

**Ramona's Aside - Middens:**
- Sam: "What?"
- Ramona explains: Like middens - mollusk and bivalve shells
- Ancient Andes civilizations - estimate population by shellfish consumption
- Can estimate civilization size within tolerance, track growth/shrinkage over time
- ~15,000 years ago
- Shows her earth science expertise

### The Landscape

- Rocks, scree, cliff sides
- High altitude shrubs (Ramona remarks on alkaline soil, what survives up here)
- Dilapidated composite plastic buildings - **NO WOOD**
- All composite materials, structurally sound but looks like crap
- The plastic just sits there forever

### Opting Out

- Eventually they start hanging back from the group
- Opt-out of the audio/visual overlay
- Chime: "Your charge is two cents. To see full itemized receipt, say 'receipt'"
- Now they're off the official trail
- Carrying their own conversation

---

## The Hike - Second Leg

### The Split

- "The next leg is optional"
- About half the people turn back
- Longer trail - ~5 kilometer walk
- Payoff is something else (sneak in a world-reveal nugget)

### The Difficulty

- More physically demanding
- **Sam struggles** - he's sedentary
- Gets monotonous
- Everything starts looking the same

---

## Ramona's Conversation (Throughout)

### About Tina

- First time Sam is coming to meet her
- Sam: "Let me guess, she looks like you?"
- Ramona: "Very funny..."
- **Tina is her identical twin** - but pale as shit (lives underground)
- She's off the grid, so Sam isn't super aware of her

### Her Background

- Earth science expertise (geology adjacent)
- Grew up Christian in the mountain
- Doesn't really practice anymore but knows all the religious stuff
- Sam grew up atheist outside the mountain
- They don't fight about it - just tease each other
- Loving couple dynamic

---

## The Marker

### What Sam Sees

- Pair of shoes thrown over something high
- NOT a tree (no trees up here)
- Some man-made remnant from mining era - figure out what
- Wire? Old equipment? Mining infrastructure?

### The Count

- Ramona starts counting under her breath
- Sam notices at ~30: she's counting steps
- At 30, she stops, looks around
- They veer off into what looks like ordinary landscape

---

## The Entrance

### The Fissure

- They have to **turn sideways** through a small crack in the rock
- Ramona puts a light on her device to illuminate
- Hidden, wouldn't attract random hikers

### The Eye of the Needle

- Second obstacle - have to **crawl under** something
- Ramona calls it "the camel's hump" or references the proverb

**The Proverb Exchange:**
- "Easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than a rich man to enter heaven"
- Sam: "Why would I know that?"
- Ramona explains: It's not really about rich people
- Jerusalem had a gate called "the Eye of the Needle"
- Camels had to go on their knees to get through
- They had to humble themselves and crawl
- Sam: "I've never heard the proverb, why would I know the subtext?"
- Ramona: "It's not a proverb, it's... heathens. Freaking atheists."
- Teasing, loving exchange

### The Second Subchamber

- After crawling through, they're in a second chamber
- Within that: the root cellar entrance

### The Root Cellar Door

- 30-degree angle, into hillside
- Concrete, old rusted-looking door
- Locks on it, looks decrepit, like it could never work
- Appears impossible to unlock

### The Reveal

- Ramona's biometrics unlock it
- When doors swing open: **well-oiled, noiseless**
- The rust/decay was camouflage
- Underneath an overhang - can't be seen from satellite
- Shockingly well-maintained illusion

---

## Scene Beats (Sequence)

6. The struggle - Sam sedentary, monotonous, everything looks same
7. Ramona conversation - Tina (identical twin, pale), her Christian background, teasing
8. The marker - shoes on mining remnant, count to 30
9. The fissure - turn sideways, light on device
10. Eye of the needle - crawl through, proverb exchange, teasing
11. Second subchamber - root cellar door, biometrics, well-oiled reveal

## Tour Stop Details

### What They See

- Ventilation shaft
- Enormous fans
- **The Boring Machine**
  - Mine suddenly lost funding
  - Transport of the equipment wasn't economical due to remote location
  - Looted shortly after mine closure, likely by some of the local workers
  - Laser for boring and blasting
- This is NOT the main shaft
  - Main shaft is in a restricted area
  - Instability, safety, etc.
- Barracks and quarters
- Big gravel road down to the dry tailings mounds, conveyor belt system

### Diagrams (on display)

- Main and ventilation shafts
- Refuge stops
- Enormous cavities where ore deposits were
- 75 meter gapped shafts

---

## Exposition: Mining Challenges

### The Challenges

- Ventilation
- Pump out groundwater / rain water
- Cooling deeper sections of the shaft
- Collapsing and stability
- Geological changes - hard vs soft rock
- Constant safety issues
- Running into highly pressurized methane or water

### Tech

- Load haul dump (automated)
- Surveying rovers
- Lidar or other imaging devices
- Robotic cable bolter

### Day in the Life

- Audio of old miners like the WW2 docs

### Environmental Impact Section

- [TBD content]

---

## Gaps to Fill

1. **What's the marker hung on?** - Not a tree. Mining remnant? Wire? Old equipment?
2. **Second gold rush name** - Fancy name for the rare earth element era
3. **Real Rossland mining history** - Research actual dates/details
4. **What's the second leg payoff?** - World-reveal nugget for those who continue
5. **Heist use of twins** - Body swap / misdirection potential (Tina is off-grid, unmonitored)
