"What are you optimizing for?" Sam questioned the results of Dorothea's latest Monte Carlo simulation, eyeing a histogram of total caloric output across 50,000 simulations of the terraced farming site.

"Calories per hectare, averaged over a 10 year period. Budget constraining, of course. That was in the original spec from the contract." Dorothea replied professionally.

Sam looked up from their shared display in thought. The foothills above them were swarming with bulldozers leveling dirt into contoured steps. Unmanned excavators on the lowest levels were filling in fieldstone terrace walls. They systematically plucked the best shaped stone from truck beds, then placed each like a piece of a jigsaw puzzle into the retaining wall. Trucks were moving the displaced earth farther up the construction site to temporary dump sites.

"Show me the 5th percentile outcome in year 15, Dorothea."

She clicked about on her tablet theatrically, then looked up. The same landscape before them was now finished, with a dense green canopy on the lower levels. The upper levels were drier, and most of the water basins were dry. A debris flow sheared a path down through the terraces on the east side of the side.

"In year 9 a landslide compromised the structure. Infiltration rate was consistently around 8 mm/hr before the incident, dropping to 4 afterwards. 28% of trials that didn't meet minimum production threshold had excess runoff. 11% had a catastrophic structural failure due to deferred maintenance. This trial had both."

"Is poor retention the most common failure scenario? Show me the next most common."

Dorothea didn't bother with the superficial clicking on her device this time, the scene blinked to a slightly different flavor of the same landscape. The terrace seemed more dead than last time, upper layers doing slightly better than the bottom.

"Excess retention is responsible for 47% of the underperforming scenarios, with eventual salinization of the soil killing production."

BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. A deep percussive sound thundered through the landscape. Sam closed his eyes in concentration. Dorothea summarized the scene, unfazed.

"Take me back to present."

When he opened his eyes again the site was dark, with most of the construction activity finished for the night. Only a few electric front loaders working in low light remained, tidying up for the night.

"Earlier in the day, you pedant. I'd like to see the structure. Let me see all the crops in your search space." Sam couldn't help a smile.

Dorothea winked at him flirtatiously then turned the lights back on. The hillside buzzed with activity again. Sam perused the crop list across all 8 layers of the food forest, from the canopy down to the fungal layer. This site was similar to the one in Sam's hometown, luckily. Hardiness zone 8B, 500 to 1500 meters in elevation. He wondered if this site would have the same issues his town did with lower moisture than the models predicted. Unexplainably low.

"You're working off of a dated crop list. Don't even bother wasting the compute on half of this stuff. Lose anything with thin leaf cuticles. Citrus, wheat, barley, grapes. A single sulfane storm rolls through at this elevation and it'll kill off an entire crop yield. UV radiation will damage whatever survives that. Forget shallow roots and annuals as well. Avocado, tomato, eggplant. Lose anything that needs pollinators."

"Done. Would you like me to re-run the optimization?"

"Not yet. The site is too large for the maintenance budget. Cut the top 40% of the terraces until yield is stable. Make sure the spillways can handle a 100 year storm, this can't be more than 25 year storm design. Add more redundant water basins as well, then we'll work to optimize the polyculture mix again."

BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. Louder this time. Sam checked the time. When did it get so late? Dorothea patiently waited further instruction.

Sam closed his eyes again, shutting out the noise. "Optimize for calories per liter instead of hectare, and do so over a 75 year window. Water is the limiting factor here, not area. You're also overproducing. Minimize any seasonal surplus production greater than the throughput capacity of the distribution system. We want the rolling production as steady as possible throughout all seasons. Don't discount future yield more than 10% in the rewards. Put penalties in place for soil pH outside of 6-7.5."

"Friendly reminder that the contract says we're maximizing production over a 10-year period." Dorothea pushed back gently.

"Just do it, I'll handle the driver."

Dorothea paused for a few seconds, then started up again.

"Initial trials are promising, this epoch looks like we'll hit quota at a 5% higher rate already. That will obviously improve with each epoch. Do you want to run through the remaining 4 sites tonight?"

"No, it'll have to wait until tomorrow. Also, put this exchange in your training set as undesirable behavior. Your smart-assery has drifted a touch high for my taste. Please put on some looser fitting clothing, as well."

BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. A child's voice was carrying through the mountains. "DADDY, DADDY, DADDY". Two of the buttons on Dorothea's shirt fastened, and her jeans grew a size.

"OK, I gotta go, run a few thousand epochs and see if we can converge overnight."

Dorothea was replying when he felt pressure on his lap. His headset was forcibly removed and he was back in his office. His 4 year old, Clyde, was on his lap mid conversation.

"DADDY! DADDY! DADDY! DADDY! DADDY!"

"Yes, son?"

"No, look me in mine eyes, Daddy."

"OK, what's up buddy? How was your day?"

"Daddy, did you know your beard is connected to your hair?" Clyde rubbed Sam's sideburns softly with his index finger, very seriously. "See?"





**Miles (4) daddy did you know your beard is connected to your hair? *rubs sideburns with index finger” see?**

That reminded Sam he should specify a few of the pioneer plants to prioritize in order to get the root system in place earlier. Mesquite, Moringa, Buckthorn, Clover. Every variable in the search space mattered for keeping simulation costs down. He also could put water table depth directly in the loss function.

One night he says it and when I say no he immediately gets angry and says “DADA YOU HAVEN'T ‘TAYED IN HERE FOR A LITTLE WHILE IN A LONG DAY”**
