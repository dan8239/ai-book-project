"What are you optimizing for?" Sam questioned the results of Dorothea's latest Monte Carlo simulation, eyeing a histogram of total caloric output across 50,000 simulations of the terraced farming site.

"Calories per hectare, averaged over a 10 year period. Budget constraining, of course. That was in the original spec from the contract," Dorothea replied professionally.

Sam looked up from their shared display in thought. The foothills above them were swarming with bulldozers leveling dirt into contoured steps. Unmanned excavators on the lowest levels were filling in fieldstone terrace walls. They systematically plucked the best shaped stone from truck beds, then placed each like a piece of a jigsaw puzzle into the retaining wall. Trucks were moving the displaced earth farther up the construction site to temporary dump sites.

"Show me the 5th percentile outcome in year 15, Dorothea."

She clicked about on her tablet theatrically, then looked up. The same landscape before them was now finished, with a dense green canopy on the lower levels. The upper levels were drier, and most of the water basins were dry. A debris flow sheared a path down through the terraces on the east side of the site.

"In year 9 a landslide compromised the structure. Infiltration rate was consistently around 8 mm/hr before the incident, dropping to 4 afterwards. 28% of trials that didn't meet minimum production threshold had excess runoff. 11% had a catastrophic structural failure due to deferred maintenance. This trial had both."

"Is poor retention the most common failure scenario? Show me the next most common."

Dorothea didn't bother with the superficial clicking on her device this time, the scene blinked to a slightly different flavor of the same landscape. The terrace seemed more dead than last time, upper layers doing slightly better than the bottom.

"Excess retention is responsible for 47% of the underperforming scenarios, with eventual salinization of the soil killing production."

BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. A deep percussive sound thundered through the landscape. Sam closed his eyes in concentration. Dorothea summarized the scene, unfazed.

"Take me back to present."

When he opened his eyes again the site was dark, with most of the construction activity finished for the night. Only a few electric front loaders working in low light remained, tidying up for the night.

"Earlier in the day, you pedant. I'd like to see the structure. Let me see all the crops in your search space." Sam couldn't help a smile.

Dorothea winked at him insolently then turned the lights back on by rewinding the scene a few hours. The hillside buzzed with activity again. Sam perused the crop list across all 8 layers of the food forest, from the canopy down to the fungal layer. This site was similar to the one in Sam's hometown, luckily. Hardiness zone 8B, 500 to 1500 meters in elevation. He wondered if this site would have the same issues his town did with lower moisture than the models predicted. Unexplainably low.

"You're working off of a dated crop list. Don't even bother wasting the compute on half of this stuff. Lose anything with thin leaf cuticles. Citrus, wheat, barley, grapes. A single sulfane storm rolls through at this elevation and it'll kill off an entire crop yield. UV radiation will damage whatever survives that. Forget shallow roots and annuals as well. Avocado, tomato, eggplant. Lose anything that needs pollinators."

"Done. Would you like me to re-run the optimization?"

"Not yet. The site is too large for the maintenance budget. Cut the top 40% of the terraces until yield is stable. Make sure the spillways can handle a 100 year storm, this can't be more than 25 year storm design. Add more redundant water basins as well, then we'll work to optimize the polyculture mix again."

BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. Louder this time. Sam checked the time. When did it get so late? Dorothea patiently waited further instruction.

Sam closed his eyes again, shutting out the noise. "Optimize for calories per liter instead of hectare, and do so over a 75 year window. Water is the limiting factor here, not area. You're also overproducing. Minimize any seasonal surplus production greater than the throughput capacity of the distribution system. We want the rolling production as steady as possible throughout all seasons."

"Friendly reminder that the contract says we're maximizing production over a 10-year period," Dorothea pushed back gently.

"Just do it, I'll handle the driver. Also, don't discount future yield more than 10% in the rewards. And put penalties in place for soil pH outside of 6-7.5."

Dorothea paused for a few seconds, then started up again. "Initial trials are promising, this epoch looks like we'll hit quota at a 5% higher rate already. That will obviously improve with each epoch. Do you want to run through the remaining 4 sites tonight?"

"No, it'll have to wait until tomorrow. Also, put this exchange in your training set as undesirable behavior. Your smart-assery has drifted a touch high for my taste. Please put on some looser fitting clothing, as well."

BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. A child's voice was carrying through the mountains. "DADDY, DADDY, DADDY". Two of the buttons on Dorothea's shirt fastened, and her jeans grew a size.

"OK, I gotta go, run a few thousand epochs and see if we can converge overnight."

Dorothea was replying when he felt pressure on his lap. His headset was forcibly removed and he was back in his office. His 4 year old, Clyde, was on his lap mid conversation.

"DADDY! DADDY! DADDY! DADDY! DADDY!"

"Yes, son?"

"No, look me in mine eyes, Daddy."

Sam turned and made eye contact, smiling. "What's up buddy? How was your day?"

"Daddy, did you know your beard is connected to your hair?" Clyde asked sternly before he rubbed Sam's sideburns with his index finger. "See?"

"No, that can't be right." Sam feigned shock, putting his fingers over Clyde's to double check.

"IT IS!" Clyde belly laughed and jumped from the swivel chair, leveraging himself off of Sam's groin.

"DADDY! 'TEVIE! 'TEVIE IS MAKING THE 'PIDER CATCH ME!" Clyde has a physical incapability of speaking at normal volume when he got excited. He sprinted out of Sam's office, then down the long hallway to the main living area. His bare feet slapped off the composite hardwood. Sam followed out into the hall and swore as he stepped on a hard dinosaur toy. He could see Clyde jumping and laughing at the end of the hall, on the edge of the kitchen.

As he turned into the open space, Clyde was running around the island and laughing, pointing to the ground. Ramona was scraping the remnants of a child's plate into the compost bin. As Clyde sprinted past, she deftly placed the fork down on the island and stopped Clyde with an open hand to his chest. She got down into a squat to talk at his level. "No sprinting through the kitchen, please. If you're going to be goofing please do it in the living room."
"OKAY MOMMY!" Clyde yelled directly into her mouth in performative compliance, then continued his elated sprint to his brother's side.

Sam kissed Ramona on the cheek and put his arms around her from behind. She smiled and collapsed gently into him, then nodded at the other end of the island.

"Your plate is ready, it might need a zap. These boys need to get up to bed. How was work?"

"Hectic, as usual! I can do bedtime. This looks great, thank you." Sam's bowl was the only one remaining on the island.

"DADDY! DADDY!" Clyde pulled at Sam's sweats as he pointed to a small 4-wheeled remote control car on the floor of the living room. He mostly made sound effects and mimed running, jumping and screaming from then on. The car was a simple matte black box with oversized wheels. It looked like a little server rack with an foam antenna sticking straight up.

Stevie was at his device, typing and smiling. "I adjusted the loss function to use shaped rewards this afternoon in class and it's doing WAY better. Look." 

Clyde laughed insanely in anticipatory joy.

Stevie pressed a button on his device and the bot spun to life. It slewed suddenly at Clyde, aligning itself in small, quick adjustments, then gave chase. Clyde ran in circles around the island, having the time of his life. Ramona closed her eyes and took a few deep breaths with her palms grounded against the island. Clyde was much faster, but the bot was relentless. It pursued until Clyde was out of sight, then would change to the other direction and surprise him as he turned the corner. Stevie laughed quietly to himself sitting on the couch.

The bot's foam antennae forked and flailed slowly when Clyde got near, attempting to tag him. Eventually Clyde abandoned the island, sliding past the bot onto his knees, then scrambling towards the corner of the living room. Now, the bot had him cornered. Tiny servo motors whined as it slowly splayed its antennae into a spider-like, frozen posture. 

Clyde gasped for breath smiling ear to ear. He took a step one way, the bot shadowed. Another way, same result. Clyde looked at his mother, then he jumped up onto the couch and ran on the cushions, cackling. The robot lagged slightly behind.

"CLYDE!" Stevie shouted as his younger brother jumped over him, gathering speed as his arms pumped wildly. 
"NO RUNNING ON THE COUCH!" The levee of Ramona's self-regulatory breath-work had finally breached.
Sam dipped his sorghum flatbread into the lukewarm sweetmash and took a bite, then popped the bowl into the microwave, pressing a few buttons.

Clyde took the turn at the elbow of the couch. The robot had taken a better angle and was catching up.

"HIIIIIIIYAHHHH!" Clyde jumped directly on the robot with arms swinging. He knocked it onto its antenna, wheels spinning back and forth, rotating itself lamely as motors whirred.

"NO HITTING, CLYDE! IT'S AGAINST THE RULES!" Stevie ran over to the device and set it upright. Clyde finally stopped swinging his arms and making punch sound effects as he saw tears welling up in Stevie's eyes.
"Sorry, 'tevie." He was genuinely remorseful, and extremely winded.

"OK boys, time for bed!" Sam got up off the island stool and walked over to the boys. Clyde sprinted down the hall, WAPwapwapwapwapwapwapwap.

"Now that they're nice and riled up," Ramona smirked.

Stevie protested as he brought the robot back over to his device. "NO! I just need a minute. I need to make sure the images still saved."

"It's time, buddy. I'll help you with it in the morning," Sam reasoned.

"YOU ALWAYS HATE ME!" Stevie shouted back at his dad.

"Steven Wesley!" Ramona defended her husband.

"That's one," Sam said calmly.

Stevie made an enraged sound of muffled protest, then stomped on down the hall. Ramona gave Sam a sympathetic pout and put her hand on his.

"It's hard being ten."

Sam followed down the hall. Stevie went into the bathroom and was brushing his teeth angrily. As Sam walked past the kids' bedroom door Clyde was midair, jumping from the top bunk. He had pulled out the trundle bed from under the bottom bunk and piled up a few stuffed animals.

"Buddy, there's a ring buffer of 15 minutes. It will have the images for your training set, even if the connection dropped for a bit. Don't worry. And I don't hate you, I love you."
Stevie spit venom (toothpaste). He didn't deign a reply.
"You know, technically that was its first time finishing the objective. That data might be your seed episode. I bet you'll go through a phase transition with a few more examples like that."
"You think so?" Stevie's rage melted.
"Sure thing! And if the shaped rewards are looking good, try curriculum rewards next. You can start by catching your little brother, then once it figures that one out have it try to catch me and your mom."

They chatted a bit longer while they brushed and peed, then cajoled Clyde into doing the same, with a little assistance. After both boys were in their pajamas they brushed aside a few dozen stuffies to make room on the trundle. The boys ran to each grab a book.

Ramona walked in and set Sam's dinner on the boys' dresser.
"Goodnight boys, I love you." She bent over and gave each a kiss and a hug as they squatted. They paid her little attention as they rifled through the bookshelf.

"Whose turn is it to pick the book?" Sam asked, legs splayed on the trundle.
"ME!" both children replied, then started bickering.
"I think we read yours last night, Stevie, it's Clyde's turn."
Stevie put his hardcover book about space back into the shelf, defeated. The binding was duct taped thoroughly. Sam couldn't recall the title hiding underneath.

Clyde plopped down on Sam's lap holding *Amazing Animals!*. Stevie sat down next to Sam on the bed, leaning on his shoulder. Sam wrapped his arms around Clyde, sitting on his lap.

"Which animal do you want tonight?"
"GRILLA!" yelled Clyde. He spun his head around frantically, then snatched his gorilla stuffy into his lap. Stevie grabbed his stuffed Tardigrade and set it beside him on the bed.
"Can't we do a different one tonight?" Stevie complained.
"We can do one for Clyde and one for you," replied Sam.

Stevie gave a futile attempt to teach Clyde how the index worked, but his younger brother started swiping pages with both hands to find the Gorilla.  The book fell open to the page as if it had it memorized. Two enormous silverbacks were depicted fighting in the center, with smaller fact boxes and images interspersed throughout the two-page spread. The page was clearly on borrowed time, clear tape holding several sections of it together.

"Daddy, grilla is unstinkable, right?" Clyde asked.
"Extinct," corrected Stevie.
"Grilla is unstinked, right?" Clyde looked up at his father.
Stevie answered for Sam. "We can bring it back if we ever wanted to, don't worry. Just gone for now."
Clyde squeezed his gorilla and squirmed a bit, finding a comfortable place on Sam's lap.

Sam started reading, with Clyde interjecting at various places he had memorized the content. "The mighty mountain gorilla was the biggest of the great apes–A forest giant that shared roughly 98.2% of it's DNA with humans. Unlike humans, however, most of their diet consisted of leaves and stems gathered..."

That reminded Sam, he had forgotten to specify to Dorothea the range of optimal grazing rotations of the terrace. They'd need goats, rabbits, and chickens on the fallow sections. He'd need to double check if the maintenance budget already had allocations for periodic rotations. He began writing out the to-do list in his head for after bedtime. He should have her reach out to his biotechnologist for drought tolerant varieties–

"OK my turn!" Stevie whipped the page back to the index. Sam realized he'd read the entire page without processing any of it. Stevie traced his finger down, then flipped systematically to the orca page. Stevie loved all of the old sea monsters. Sam let Stevie take the wheel and read to Clyde for a few more minutes.

When Stevie was finished, Sam very theatrically held both sides of the book and snapped it closed with an elongated "Theeeeeeeeeeeeeee END." Clyde pulled his hand back and giggled.

"Daddy, can we play H-O-R-S-E?" Stevie tried to stretch the evening. He stood up quickly and got a few shots up on his miniature basketball hoop hanging on the door.

"Not tonight, buddy, it's late," replied Sam automatically.

Stevie dropped the ball with minimal protest, then declared the start of the race with an auctioneer's cadence, "FIRST ONE ON PILLOW GETS BACK SCRATCHED FIRST!" He dove into the lower bunk, while Clyde slammed his head into the trundle pillow and pulled the covers up. They argued over who was first. Clyde liked the trundle, Stevie the lower bunk. The top bunk was typically without biological life, pioneered only by stuffies.

Sam scratched Clyde's back with his left, and Stevie's with his right hand. The stuffed animals reminded Sam he should specify a few of the pioneer plants to prioritize in order to get the root system in place earlier. Mesquite (with careful isolation), Moringa, Buckthorn, Clover. Every variable you could fix in the search space mattered for keeping simulation costs down. He also could put water table depth directly in the loss function.

"DAD." Stevie had been saying something.

"Sorry, what did you say, buddy?" Sam refocused. Stevie was fading, Clyde was blinking slowly but alert on his belly.

"Did you know Olympus Mons is so big that if you stood on top you wouldn't even know you were on a mountain? The slope is so gradual your brain would think you were on flat ground." Stevie spoke with his cheek to the mattress, eye level with his dad.
"Wow, I didn't know that," Sam replied neutrally.
"And the base is wider than a whole hex. And it's 3 times taller than Mount Everest." 
"I think I knew that last one."
"Dad, did you know it takes 20 minutes for light to get there. So every robot on Mars has to think for itself. If it gets stuck in a hole, it's 40 minutes before anyone even knows."
"Well I'm glad you're learning how to build them then! Someone has to teach those robots about potholes."
"Dad, did you know the first people on Mars lived inside a glacier? They melted tunnels into the ice cap and used the water for drinking AND for their house."
"Yes, I learned that when I was a kid, too. Did you learn that at school?"
"My teacher told me and my assistant told me, too. I'm going to live on Mars when I grow up. You and mom and Clyde can come, too." 

Sam replied pragmatically. "Well, there's still only a few people that get to go there each mission. And they're still a LONG ways away from sustainable agriculture. They're still pretty much entirely reliant on imports from–"
Stevie's snoring cued him to cut his speech short. He stopped the back rubs and kissed both the boys on the cheek.

Clyde showed some final signs of life. "Daddy, my friend Alonzo's dad is on Mars and he's going to visit him for Christmas in a 'paceship."

Ramona projected her voice from the bedroom across the hall. "I know Allie and Marcus, he lives a mile down the road so don't believe Alonzo's little tales, Clyde!"

"Goodnight, boys, I love you." Sam went back for one more hug each.

Clyde rolled over and put his hand directly over Sam's face. "Dada will you 'tay in here a little while?" he asked sweetly.

"Not tonight, buddy, next week."

Clyde was very hurt. "DADA YOU HAVEN'T 'TAYED IN HERE FOR A LITTLE WHILE IN A LONG DAY. AND YOU SAID LASTERDAY YOU WOULD 'TAY IN HERE A LITTLE WHILE."

"It's yesterday," Stevie mumbled, barely audible, dreaming.

"No, buddy. I stayed last night until you were both asleep, remember? And I said next WEEK, not tomorrow. So in 6 more days I'll stay, deal? I can't stay on this little bed more than once a week or I'm going to need to get back surgery. I love you, I'll see you in the morning."
Clyde surprisingly didn't press the issue.  He sighed, rolled over and put up no further resistance.

Sam grunted himself off the bed on the floor, grabbing his dinner off of the dresser as he said goodnight one last time. He turned out the lights, closed the door, and walked across the hall to the master. Ramona was sitting on the bed with her legs crossed, laundry in orbit around her on the bed. The room was dim, quiet music played from her device. Sam collapsed on the edge and started matching socks between mouthfuls of his cold-again sweetmash.

"You know he really loves when you play basketball with him," Ramona nudged, gently.
"How were they today?" Sam mumbled, mouth full.
"Good. Clyde has a field trip to the planetarium, he asked if you could go. They're looking for chaperones."
"I bet Stevie's jealous"


"We should just buy all identical socks, it would make life a lot easier." 
"I don't mind folding, it's quite zen. I could go without the dishes, though." Ramona glanced at Sam's bowl on the comforter.
"I'll put it away before bed. Why don't you let me buy us a domestic unit? What's all the money for if we don't ever spend it?"
"Those things give me the creeps. We can take care of ourselves just fine. This thing is bad enough." She held her arm up, gesturing to the LifeMonitor embedded subcutaneously.
Sam finished up the socks and was starting to put stacks of clothes back into the dressers. "Oh, you're paranoid. You can put it on silent and you won't even see the thing. Let yourself be happy."
"I am very happy, dear. Besides, I think we'll need to budget for something else shortly." She flipped a small plastic stick to him and finished up her stack of clothing.


Well, I think "
