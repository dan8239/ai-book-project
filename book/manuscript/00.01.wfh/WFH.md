"What are you optimizing for?" Sam scrutinized the results

1. Land survey with Dorothea
	1. monte carlo simulation
	2. uncertainty thresholds
	3. optimizing for the wrong thing
	4. land being worked on in real time
2. Banging through his headset
	1. The world BOOMED three times
	2. Dorothea doesn't notice
3. Continues working
	1. Dorothea starts to show herself as beyond human capable
	2. They can manipulate the land (fast forward 18 months, median outcome)
	3. Give me the histogram before and after
	4. We're exposed to an entire crop failure through one pathway, it's too dependent on one thing
	5. It's eroding the soil over time as well, have to add some guardrails to the projected balance
4. Banging through headset again
	1. Louder
	2. 5 times
	3. He checks the time, fuck it's already xyz time
5. Continues going
	1. OK give me real time again
	2. No not like literally this time, how about earlier today when the sun was out
	3. OK, adjust the time horizon on the yield, maximize over 75 years instead of 20, reduce the future penalty on rewards
	4. Put topsoil depth and pH into the loss function directly I think it will help stabilize it a bit more
6. Banging through headset a third time, far off voice
	1. It's his kid, not his wife
	2. DADDY, THE FISH DIED
	3. Wife has one plate out with his food on it, the rest of the plates are bussed
	4. He takes it up to their room
	5. The other kid is jumping from the top bunk down onto the trundle bed
	6. They overwhelm him
	7. Get them to bed, but have goals
		1. build character
		2. colonize mars stuff
		3. show them really advanced reading
		4. kid wants him to chaperone on the field trip
7. Brings his dish right into bed and collapses into it
	1. Wife is perfect
	2. She talks about the kids, not them
	3. You should be there. He has a field trip next week kind of thing (or cats/rats)
	4. Convo goes to 3rd kid
	5.
