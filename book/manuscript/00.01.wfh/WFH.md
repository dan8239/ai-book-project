"What are you optimizing for?" Sam questioned the results of Dorothea's latest Monte Carlo simulation, eyeing a histogram of total caloric output across 50,000 simulations of the terraced farming site.

"Calories per hectare, averaged over a 10 year period. Budget constraining, of course. That was in the original spec from the contract." Dorothea replied professionally.

Sam looked up from their shared display in thought. The foothills above them were swarming with bulldozers leveling dirt into contoured steps. Unmanned excavators on the lowest levels were filling in fieldstone terrace walls. They systematically plucked the best shaped stone from truck beds, then placed each like a piece of a jigsaw puzzle into the retaining wall. Trucks were moving the displaced earth farther up the construction site to temporary dump sites.

"Show me the 5th percentile outcome in year 15, Dorothea."

She clicked about on her tablet theatrically, then looked up. The same landscape before them was now finished, with a dense green canopy on the lower levels. The upper levels were drier, and most of the water basins were dry. A debris flow sheared a path down through the terraces on the east side of the side.

"In year 9 a landslide compromised the structure. Infiltration rate was consistently around 8 mm/hr before the incident, dropping to 4 afterwards. 28% of trials that didn't meet minimum production threshold had excess runoff. 11% had a catastrophic structural failure due to deferred maintenance. This trial had both."

"Is poor retention the most common failure scenario? Show me the next most common."

Dorothea didn't bother with the superficial clicking on her device this time, the scene blinked to a slightly different flavor of the same landscape. The terrace seemed more dead than last time, upper layers doing slightly better than the bottom.

"Excess retention is responsible for 47% of the underperforming scenarios, with eventual salinization of the soil killing production."

BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. A deep percussive sound thundered through the landscape. Sam closed his eyes in concentration. Dorothea summarized the scene, unfazed.

"Take me back to present."

When he opened his eyes again the site was dark, with most of the construction activity finished for the night. Only a few electric front loaders working in low light remained, tidying up for the night.

"Earlier in the day, you pedant. I'd like to see the structure. Let me see all the crops in your search space." Sam couldn't help a smile.

Dorothea winked at him flirtatiously then turned the lights back on. The hillside buzzed with activity again. Sam perused the crop list across all 8 layers of the food forest, from the canopy down to the fungal layer. This site was similar to the one in Sam's hometown, luckily. Hardiness zone 8B, 500 to 1500 meters in elevation. He wondered if this site would have the same issues his town did with lower moisture than the models predicted. Unexplainably low.

"You're working off of a dated crop list. Don't even bother wasting the compute on half of this stuff. Lose anything with thin leaf cuticles. Citrus, wheat, barley, grapes. A single sulfane storm rolls through at this elevation and it'll kill off an entire crop yield. UV radiation will damage whatever survives that. Forget shallow roots and annuals as well. Avocado, tomato, eggplant. Lose anything that needs pollinators."

"Done. Would you like me to re-run the optimization?"

"Not yet. The site is too large for the maintenance budget. Cut the top 40% of the terraces until yield is stable. Make sure the spillways can handle a 100 year storm, this can't be more than 25 year storm design. Add more redundant water basins as well, then we'll work to optimize the polyculture mix again."

BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. Louder this time. Sam checked the time. When did it get so late? Dorothea patiently waited further instruction.

Sam closed his eyes again, shutting out the noise. "Optimize for calories per liter instead of hectare, and do so over a 75 year window. Water is the limiting factor here, not area. You're also overproducing. Minimize any seasonal surplus production greater than the throughput capacity of the distribution system. We want the rolling production as steady as possible throughout all seasons. Don't discount future yield more than 10% in the rewards. Put penalties in place for soil pH outside of 6-7.5."

"Friendly reminder that the contract says we're maximizing production over a 10-year period." Dorothea pushed back gently.

"Just do it, I'll handle the driver."

Dorothea paused for a few seconds, then started up again.

"Initial trials are promising, this epoch looks like we'll hit quota at a 5% higher rate already. That will obviously improve with each epoch. Do you want to run through the remaining 4 sites tonight?"

"No, it'll have to wait until tomorrow. Also, put this exchange in your training set as undesirable behavior. Your smart-assery has drifted a touch high for my taste. Please put on some looser fitting clothing, as well."

BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. A child's voice was carrying through the mountains. "DADDY, DADDY, DADDY". Two of the buttons on Dorothea's shirt fastened, and her jeans grew a size.

"OK, I gotta go, run a few thousand epochs and see if we can converge overnight."

Dorothea was replying when he felt pressure on his lap. His headset was forcibly removed and he was back in his office. His 4 year old, Clyde, was on his lap mid conversation.

"DADDY! DADDY! DADDY! DADDY! DADDY!"

"Yes, son?"

"No, look me in mine eyes, Daddy."

Sam turned and made eye contact, smiling. "What's up buddy? How was your day?"

"Daddy, did you know your beard is connected to your hair?" Clyde asked sternly as rubbed Sam's sideburns with his index finger. "See?"

"No, that can't be right." Sam feigned shock, putting his fingers over Clyde's to double check.

"IT IS!" Clyde belly laughed and jumped from the swivel chair, leveraging himself off of Sam's groin.

"DADDY! 'TEVIE! 'TEVIE IS MAKING THE 'PIDER CATCH ME!" Clyde has a physical incapability of speaking at normal volume when he got excited. He sprinted out of Sam's office, then down the long hallway to the main living area. His bare feet slapped off the composite hardwood. Sam followed out into the hall and swore as he stepped on a hard dinosaur toy. He could see Clyde jumping and laughing at the end of the hall, on the edge of the kitchen.

As he turned into the open space, Clyde was running around the island and laughing, pointing to the ground. Ramona was scraping the remnants of a child's plate into the compost bin. As Clyde sprinted past, she deftly placed the fork down on the island and stopped Clyde with an open hand to his chest. She got down into a squat to talk at his level. "No sprinting through the kitchen, please. If you're going to be goofing please do it in the living room."
"OKAY MOMMY!" Clyde yelled directly into her mouth in performative compliance, then continued his elated sprint to his brother's side.

Sam kissed Ramona on the cheek and put his arms around her from behind. She smiled and collapsed gently into him, then nodded at the other end of the island. "Your plate is ready, it might need a zap. These boys need to get up to bed. How was work?"

"Hectic, as usual! I can do bedtime. This looks great, thank you." Sam's bowl was the only one remaining on the island.

"DADDY! DADDY!" Clyde pulled at Sam's sweats as he pointed to a small 4-wheeled remote control car on the floor of the living room. He mostly made sound effects and mimed running, jumping and screaming from then on. The car was a simple matte black box with oversized wheels. It looked like a little server rack with an foam antenna sticking straight up.

Stevie was at his device, typing and smiling. "I adjusted the loss function to use shaped rewards this afternoon in class and it's doing WAY better. Look." 

Clyde laughed insanely in anticipatory joy.

Stevie pressed a button on his device and the bot spun to life. It slewed suddenly at Clyde, aligning itself in small, quick adjustments, then gave chase. and Clyde ran in circles around the island, having the time of his life. Ramona closed her eyes and took a few deep breaths with her palms grounded against the island. Clyde was much faster, but the bot was relentless. It pursued until Clyde was out of sight, then would change to the other direction and surprise him as he turned the corner. Stevie laughed quietly to himself sitting on the couch.

The bot's foam antennae forked and flailed slowly when Clyde got near, attempting to tag him. Eventually Clyde abandoned the island, sliding past the bot onto his knees, then scrambling towards the corner of the living room. Now, the bot had him cornered. Tiny servo motors whined as it slowly splayed its antennae into a spider-like, frozen posture. 

Clyde laughed maniacally, covering his face with his hands, gasping for breath. He took a step one way, the bot shadowed. Another way, same result. Clyde looked at his mother, then he jumped up onto the couch and ran on the cushions, cackling. The robot mirrored Clyde's movement, lagging slightly behind.

"CLYDE!" Stevie shouted as his younger brother jumped over him, gathering speed as his arms pumped wildly. 
"NO RUNNING ON THE COUCH!" The levy of Ramona's self-regulatory breath-work had finally breeched.
Sam dipped his flatbread into the lukewarm sweetmash and took a bite, then popped the bowl into the microwave, pressing a few buttons.

Clyde took the turn at the elbow of the couch. The robot had taken a better angle and was catching up.

"HIIIIIIIYAHHHH!" Clyde jumped directly on the robot with arms swinging. He knocked it onto its antenna, wheels spinning back and forth, rotating itself lamely as motors whirred.

"NO HITTING, CLYDE! IT'S AGAINST THE RULES!" Stevie ran over to the device and set it upright. Clyde finally stopped swinging his arms and making punch sound effects as he saw tears welling up in Stevie's eyes.
"Sorry, 'tevie." He was genuinely remorseful, and extremely winded.

"OK boys, time for bed!" Sam got up off the island stool and walked over to the boys. Clyde sprinted down the hall, WAPwapwapwapwapwapwapwap.
"Now that they're nice and riled up." Ramona smirked.
Stevie protested as he brought the robot back over to his device. "NO! I just need a minute. I need to make sure the images still saved."
"It's time, buddy. I'll help you with it in the morning." Sam reasoned.
"YOU ALWAYS HATE ME!" Stevie shouted back at his dad.
"Stevie!" Ramona defended her husband.
"That's one." Sam said, calmly.
Stevie made an enraged sound of muffled protest, then stomped on down the hall. Ramona gave Sam a sympathetic pout. "It's hard being ten."

Sam followed down the hall. Stevie went into the bathroom and was brushing his teeth angrily. As Sam walked past the kids' bedroom door Clyde was midair, jumping from the top bunk. He had pulled out the trundle bed from under the bottom bunk and piled up a few stuffed animals.

"Buddy, there's a ring buffer of 15 minutes. It will have the images for your training set, even if the connection dropped for a bit. Don't worry. And I don't hate you, I love you."
Stevie spit venom (toothpaste). He didn't deign a reply.
"You know, technically that was its first time winning the game. That data might be your seed episode. I bet you'll go through a phase transition with a few more examples like that."
"You think so?" Stevie's rage melted.
"Sure thing! And if the shaped rewards are looking good, try curriculum rewards next. You can start by catching your little brother, then once it figures that one out have it try to catch me and your mom."

They chatted a bit longer while they brushed and peed, then cajoled Clyde into doing the same, with a little assistance. After both boys were in their pajamas they brushed aside a few dozen stuffies to make room on the trundle. The boys ran to each grab a book.

Ramona walked in and set Sam's dinner on the boys' dresser.
"Goodnight boys, I love you." She bent over and gave each a kiss and a hug as they squatted, rifling through the bookshelf.

*** book should remind him of work

*** check notes, animal history book, maybe save space book for later

*** make sure to drop a space colonization thing if not though

*** maybe just one-liner the amazing mammals stuff, describing him turning the pages too quickly.

That reminded Sam he should specify a few of the pioneer plants to prioritize in order to get the root system in place earlier. Mesquite, Moringa, Buckthorn, Clover. Every variable in the search space mattered for keeping simulation costs down. He also could put water table depth directly in the loss function.

Then at bedtime use this one

"FIRST ONE ON PILLOW GETS BACK SCRATCHED FIRST!" Stevie dove into the lower bunk, while Clyde slammed his head into the trundle pillow and pulled the covers up. They argued over who was first. Clyde liked the trundle, Stevie the lower bunk. The top bunk was colonized entirely by stuffies.

Sam scratched Clyde's back with his left, and Stevie's with his right hand. His mind was drifting back to the
