# 00.01 Work From Home

## Scene Goals

1. **Establish competence** — Sam is very good at what he does
2. **Establish the flaw** — he's choosing work over family, right now, in real time
3. **Tone promise** — AI, space (breadcrumb), mystery (something slightly off)
4. **AI colleague** — Dorothea not revealed as AI immediately

## Sam's Contract: Highland Food Forest Optimization

### The Job
Sam optimizes species mix and genetic tuning of highland food forests for specific sites. Every site is different — elevation, aspect, soil depth, proximity to storm corridors, water availability. He runs genetic algorithms on the roster: which species at what densities at what spacing to maximize caloric output per liter of water. Also pushes genetics — Monte Carlo on mutation profiles for more UV-resistant sorghum, higher-yield cassava, etc.

### The Food Forest Layers (Zone 8/9b, arid highland, elevated UV, occasional H2S storms)

**Canopy (10-30m):**
- Pinyon pine — pine nuts 600+ kcal/100g, resinous bark/needles resist sulfide absorption, high UV tolerance
- Moringa — every part edible, fast-growing, resprouts aggressively from trunk after sulfide damage
- Mesquite (Prosopis) — nitrogen-fixer, drought-proof, pods grindable into flour. **Use carefully — aggressive spreader**

**Understory (3-10m):**
- Olive — waxy leaves, extreme drought tolerance, 800 kcal/100g oil, thick cuticle resists H2S uptake
- Fig — arid-adapted, deep taproot, drops leaves under stress and regrows
- Pomegranate — hard drought tolerance, thick rind protects fruit from UV
- Pistachio — arid-native, deep taproot, thick shell protects calorie payload

**Shrub (1-3m):**
- Prickly pear (Opuntia) — CAM photosynthesis, stomata closed daytime = H2S resistant. Pads and fruit edible.
- Saltbush (Atriplex) — survives saline/arid/toxic soils, edible leaves
- Rosemary, sage, lavender — aromatic oils partially repel gas absorption
- Sea buckthorn — nitrogen-fixer, nutritious berries

**Herbaceous (perennials):**
- Amaranth — complete protein, reseeds aggressively, annual dodges long-term H2S
- Agave — CAM plant (H2S resistant), calorie-dense sap, fiber
- Tepary bean — most drought-tolerant bean on earth, nitrogen-fixer, regrows from root
- Sorghum — replaced wheat in this world, waxy stem coating, highest UV tolerance of any cereal

**Ground cover:**
- Purslane — succulent, omega-3 rich, thick waxy leaves resist gas exchange under stress
- Ice plant — CAM metabolism, salt-tolerant, edible
- Creeping thyme — aromatic oil barrier, UV-tolerant
- Subterranean clover — nitrogen-fixer, self-buries seeds (next generation underground even if surface killed)

**Vine:**
- Passionfruit — deep roots, aggressive regrowth from base after dieback
- Chayote — massive tuber underground (calorie store safe from H2S), vine regrows
- Lablab bean — tropical nitrogen-fixer, drought-tolerant

**Root/rhizosphere:**
- Cassava — calorie king, 160 kcal/100g, grows in terrible soil, tuber protected underground
- Sweet potato — underground protection, fast/dense growth
- Yacon — Andean tuber, drought-tolerant
- Groundnut (Apios americana) — nitrogen-fixing tuber
- Taro — if irrigated. Polynesian staple (connects to waka metaphor)

## Excluded Species (zone 8/9b failures in this world)

| Species | Why it fails |
|---------|-------------|
| Citrus (orange, lemon, grapefruit) | Thin leaf cuticles, high stomatal density. One sulfide storm kills entire orchard. No resprout from root. Years of growth lost in one afternoon. |
| Avocado | Shallow roots, 270 liters per fruit. Obscene water cost in arid highland. Poor H2S recovery. |
| Tomato, eggplant (Solanaceae) | Thin-skinned, high stomatal density, shallow roots. H2S kills outright. UV degrades fruit. Survive only in underground farms. |
| Almond | 12 liters per nut. Also needs pollinators — insect populations devastated by UV and H2S. No pollinators, no almonds. |
| Wheat, barley | Thin stalks, high surface area, no cuticle protection. One sulfide event flattens a field. Grow underground only. |
| Grapes | Thin leaves, shallow roots, need specific humidity. UV burns fruit, H2S kills foliage. Wine is a memory. |

## The House

~2000 sqft, long skinny footprint like a Chicago two-flat. 2 bed 2 bath. Nothing crazy — first-gen wealthy, neither Sam nor Ramona has the instinct to sprawl. Money goes to museum scheme, energy credits for the mountain, Sam's work infrastructure.

The house is a mess. Evidence of one-parent operation. Ramona is outnumbered by two kids (almost three), Sam is absent. At some point Sam offers to get a domestic unit to help. "You can put them in stealth, it's like they're not even there." Ramona's reaction TBD but this is a character beat — he solves human problems with machines.

## The Kids

**Clyde (4)** — the sideburn kid. Bedtime book: *Amazing Animals* — woolly mammoths, Haast's eagle, woolly rhino, gorillas. Notes in the book mention all elephants, all eagles/vultures/hawks gone (some falcons remain). Rhinos, gorillas, orangutans extinct. Book is dog-eared and taped back together.

**Stevie (9)** — reads first at bedtime. Book about the solar system. He's basically editorializing at this point, not reading — knows it by heart. Goes over the sun's core and atmospheric layers briefly. How it will swallow Earth whole. Book is dog-eared and taped back together.

### Recurring beat: the activity Sam keeps refusing

Stevie asks Sam to do something with him — play H-O-R-S-E, a board game, build something, TBD. First time: bedtime, can't do it. Later in book: refuses for work. End of book: Sam finally does the thing. "Have you ever seen a real horse, daddy?" Ramona is finishing up *Amazing Animals* with Clyde in the background.

### Stuffies

Stuffed tardigrade, woolly mammoth, dinosaurs. Kids don't know what half of them are. Just soft and named something absurd.

## Pillow Talk

- Wife's dinner plate is out, rest bussed. He takes his plate to bed.
- She talks about the kids, not them. Field trip, etc.
- He offers domestic unit. She declines or deflects.
- 3rd kid reveal. Not a bomb — intimate, she's been waiting for the right moment.
- 3rd kid surcharge: "We pay the surcharge. It's nobody's business." She got a look from the doctor / a neighbor said something. The judgment isn't financial — it's moral. He writes a check for a problem she carries the weight of.
- His reaction to pregnancy: first instinct logistical/financial, catches himself, Ramona clocks the delay.

## TODO

- [ ] Define the specific site/contract Sam is finishing
- [ ] Dorothea introduction — colleague dynamic before AI reveal
- [ ] The "wrong thing" in this scene — what is Sam optimizing for that misses the point?
- [ ] Mechanism for Honeycomb job to enter his awareness
- [ ] Stevie's activity — what does he keep asking Sam to do? (H-O-R-S-E? Board game? Build something?)
- [ ] Domestic unit beat — Sam's offer, Ramona's response
