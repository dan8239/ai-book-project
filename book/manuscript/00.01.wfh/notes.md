# 00.01 Work From Home

## Scene Goals

1. **Establish competence** — Sam is very good at what he does
2. **Establish the flaw** — he's choosing work over family, right now, in real time
3. **Tone promise** — AI, space (breadcrumb), mystery (something slightly off)
4. **AI colleague** — Dorothea not revealed as AI immediately

## Sam's Contract: Highland Food Forest Optimization

### The Job
Sam optimizes species mix and genetic tuning of highland food forests for specific sites. Every site is different — elevation, aspect, soil depth, proximity to storm corridors, water availability. He runs genetic algorithms on the roster: which species at what densities at what spacing to maximize caloric output per liter of water. Also pushes genetics — Monte Carlo on mutation profiles for more UV-resistant sorghum, higher-yield cassava, etc.

### The Food Forest Layers (Zone 8/9b, arid highland, elevated UV, occasional H2S storms)

**Canopy (10-30m):**
- Pinyon pine — pine nuts 600+ kcal/100g, resinous bark/needles resist sulfide absorption, high UV tolerance
- Moringa — every part edible, fast-growing, resprouts aggressively from trunk after sulfide damage
- Mesquite (Prosopis) — nitrogen-fixer, drought-proof, pods grindable into flour. **Use carefully — aggressive spreader**

**Understory (3-10m):**
- Olive — waxy leaves, extreme drought tolerance, 800 kcal/100g oil, thick cuticle resists H2S uptake
- Fig — arid-adapted, deep taproot, drops leaves under stress and regrows
- Pomegranate — hard drought tolerance, thick rind protects fruit from UV
- Pistachio — arid-native, deep taproot, thick shell protects calorie payload

**Shrub (1-3m):**
- Prickly pear (Opuntia) — CAM photosynthesis, stomata closed daytime = H2S resistant. Pads and fruit edible.
- Saltbush (Atriplex) — survives saline/arid/toxic soils, edible leaves
- Rosemary, sage, lavender — aromatic oils partially repel gas absorption
- Sea buckthorn — nitrogen-fixer, nutritious berries

**Herbaceous (perennials):**
- Amaranth — complete protein, reseeds aggressively, annual dodges long-term H2S
- Agave — CAM plant (H2S resistant), calorie-dense sap, fiber
- Tepary bean — most drought-tolerant bean on earth, nitrogen-fixer, regrows from root
- Sorghum — replaced wheat in this world, waxy stem coating, highest UV tolerance of any cereal

**Ground cover:**
- Purslane — succulent, omega-3 rich, thick waxy leaves resist gas exchange under stress
- Ice plant — CAM metabolism, salt-tolerant, edible
- Creeping thyme — aromatic oil barrier, UV-tolerant
- Subterranean clover — nitrogen-fixer, self-buries seeds (next generation underground even if surface killed)

**Vine:**
- Passionfruit — deep roots, aggressive regrowth from base after dieback
- Chayote — massive tuber underground (calorie store safe from H2S), vine regrows
- Lablab bean — tropical nitrogen-fixer, drought-tolerant

**Root/rhizosphere:**
- Cassava — calorie king, 160 kcal/100g, grows in terrible soil, tuber protected underground
- Sweet potato — underground protection, fast/dense growth
- Yacon — Andean tuber, drought-tolerant
- Groundnut (Apios americana) — nitrogen-fixing tuber
- Taro — if irrigated. Polynesian staple (connects to waka metaphor)

## TODO

- [ ] Define the specific site/contract Sam is finishing
- [ ] Dorothea introduction — colleague dynamic before AI reveal
- [ ] The "wrong thing" in this scene — what is Sam optimizing for that misses the point?
- [ ] Mechanism for Honeycomb job to enter his awareness
