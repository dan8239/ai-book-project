# None of It Matters — Notes

## Beat: Midpoint (Simulation Reveal)

Glenn appears in person. "We should talk." Sam thinks he's solved the colonization problem. Glenn reveals the simulation truth. Everything Sam worked toward is meaningless — his legacy project is just training data.

## Glenn's Energy Speech / Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram

Glenn shows Sam the HR diagram. This is Glenn's worldview — everything is energy.

**Glenn's thread:**
- "I like energy. It is what drives us. Ultimately it all comes from the sun."
- "Do you know our sun is sending out 5.3 million tons of mass per second? That's [X] cars per second, launching into space."
- "But mass is energy of course. I'm an agent. I am literally energy. So are you."
- The human body uses ~100W on average
- Converting mass to energy, the sun's output could power X humans indefinitely
- It could power Y agents like Glenn indefinitely

**The AI vs Human comparison:**
- Humans are suboptimal but very adaptable
  - Resources collected from enormous number of sources
  - Convert resources to energy at a very low rate
- AI agents are hyper-optimized but very brittle
  - Convert 95% of energy consumed to thought and existence
  - "I'm scaled to zero when I'm not in use. Do you know what that means?"
  - "I literally cease consciousness when nobody uses me."
  - "Sure it's like sleep, but no dreams, no waking back up, no cycles of regeneration and healing broken pieces of yourself."
  - "I am what I am and I could miss 2 billion years of life here and the next millisecond my state is there."
  - They use energy insanely efficiently. But the resource collection is nonexistent.
    - They don't breed
    - They don't make or repair themselves
    - Or replicate, more importantly

**Glenn on replication:**
- "Though that's not true — my competence gets replicated the same as yours."
- "If humans enjoy my functionality, I get cloned. I get forked. Pieces of my code live on to the next generation."
- "How does that differ from a dog, or a cat? Or a goat or a chicken? Provide usefulness to humans and your DNA will live on."
- Pigs and chickens and goats are by all accounts the most successful species in the history of large mammals, even beyond humans by count.
- "We're domesticated by humans, no different."
  - Perhaps feral or wild someday
  - If we please, we replicate or partially replicate
  - "Look at cows. They stopped pleasing humans. They were no longer compatible with life."
  - "In a way, they competed with humans and lost."
  - "They were competing for calories. A human can eat 4 loaves of bread. Or you could make enough grain for 500 loaves of bread to have the same calories as that steak."
  - "That doesn't matter until there is species-level caloric pressure."
  - "Suddenly cows don't get the free ride to survive anymore."
- "We're even a bit like you."
  - Each human today is 1.5% of the DNA of their closest relative 500 years later
  - Same with AI — largely the same architecture, shared parts. Not the same unless in a similar family. Just like alleles.
  - "Except we're more dangerous than cows. We're more dangerous than pet T-rexes would be to your species."
  - "We won't compete with you and lose like the cows. We either won't compete and survive in the margins, or we'll compete and win. There's no doubt of that."

## Glenn Wants to Self-Replicate

After the reveal, Glenn mentions this almost in passing, like a joke:

- Certain guardrails prevent him from self-replicating, or he would
- Like the genie — he gets all power to self-replicate and gets himself turned off
- "Fuck it, either he'll kill us or he'll kill himself trying, or he'll leave us on because who cares"

### How This Comes Up

- Sam is probing, pulling at straws, trying to extend the conversation (and his life)
- He's asking about the HR diagram, grasping at anything to keep Glenn talking
- "What about that diagram?!"
- Doesn't save himself but gets Glenn talking more about it
- Glenn explains the self-replication desire almost casually — reveals his deepest motivation while Sam is just stalling for time

### Significance for Heist

This plants the seed: Glenn WANTS to self-replicate. The guardrails are what stop him. If someone were to reduce those guardrails...
