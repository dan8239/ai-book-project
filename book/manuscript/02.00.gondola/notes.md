# 02.XX Gondola

## Scene Goals

1. **World reveal:** Legacy human civilization is far bigger than Sam thought
	1. He believed: small extended family, 5-30 people
	2. Reality: more people under this mountain than in the city above (~10,000)
	3. Changes the scope of what he's been doing with energy/donations
2. **Sam realizes** he's been unknowingly keeping the ski resort functional through donations, funneling energy into their systems
	1. His wife has been managing this through him
	2. He's finally understanding the scope of what he let her do
3. **First underground visit** - wondrous, bustling, alive in unexpected ways
4. World reveal
	1. This is canada but it's a desert

## Setup

- Right before this scene: Ramona convinces Sam to come out (mechanism TBD)
- Just Sam and Ramona, no one else
- Kids at school
- Her belly getting bigger (passage of time marker)

---

## The Mountain (Symbolic Layer)

The mountain is a metaphor for **snapshots in time**. Everything Sam sees represents a different era frozen in rock.

### Ramona's Expertise

Ramona studied geology (or adjacent field). She can speak to the rock strata. Sam doesn't care as much - he's in the clouds mentally, barely noticing.

### Visual Layers (Bottom to Top)

**The lowlands (by city/river):**
- Terraced agriculture near the river
- Open woodland just beyond
- Transitions to grassland
- Then shrubland
- Then desert toward the horizon

**Going up the mountain:**
- Small patches of pine (struggling, beetle-kill)
- Mostly Joshua tree and yucca
- Bare exposed rock as elevation increases
- No snow, no snowcaps - barren granite and moss

### The Rock Itself (Millions of Years)

**Dry canyons:**
- Water carved these for millions of years
- Now no water to speak of
- The absence is the story

**Exposed strata (like tree rings, each stripe = millions of years):**
- Gray and white striped metamorphic rock
- Red rock hardscape
- Shale
- Mudstone
- Sandstone
- Beautiful colored stripes exposed by erosion

Sam might notice in passing. Ramona can explain. Reader connects it to the theme: we're all just snapshots, moments frozen in time, waiting to be compressed.

## The Gondola Ride

### Setting

- British Columbia, Canada - should be extremely cold
- Instead: desert mountain
- Late fall / January - sunrise very late at this latitude (9-10am at solstice)
- They can see sunrise coming up, blinding them as they ascend

### What Sam Sees Going Up

| Zone | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Base | Quiet wellness/rehab town, few people |
| Lower slopes | Deadfall, beetle-killed pines, some autumn color |
| Mid-mountain | Joshua trees, yucca, exposed rock |
| Upper | Bare granite, moss, lichen, no snow |
| Summit | Ski lodge converted to hiking trailhead |

### Skiing Memory (Brief)

Sam's never actually been up this mountain for skiing. Brief exchange:
- "So they had sticks on their feet and just... rode down?"
- "They needed snow."
- Leave it at that - they don't really know what skiing was, haven't seen it

### The Wildlife Shift

- Desertified landscape
- No snowcaps
- Species that used to be 500km south now dominate
- Mosses, lichens, whatever survives desert mountainscapes
- Beautiful but wrong

---

## Ramona's Briefing (In Gondola)

Before they arrive, Ramona briefs Sam:
- "Don't speak unless spoken to"
- "We'll meet [so-and-so]"
- Rules of entry
- He needs to follow her lead

---

## Gaps to Fill

1. **How does Ramona convince Sam to come?** - What's the inciting reason for this visit?
2. **Ramona's geology expertise** - What specifically did she study? How does she explain the strata?

## TODO: Pacing & Tension

### Problem
The gondola chapter reads as a sweet, playful date. That's good — but it currently has no undercurrent of tension. Structurally, it sits between the Birthday Dinner (where Sam rejected his wife's intimacy and logged back on) and Contact (where motivations collide). It needs to carry some weight from what came before and foreshadow what's coming.

### Option A: Thread mystery clues into the ride
Sam is physically present but mentally chewing on the work anomalies from Space Progress (memory allocation, ancient OS, population bottleneck). He notices something about the gondola's navigation system, the billing infrastructure, or the resort's energy grid that reminds him of what he found. Ramona's geology lecture ("snapshots in time," "millions of years frozen in rock") echoes the simulation timestamps without Sam making the connection. The mystery stays in his head and the reader's even during a scenic chapter.

### Option B: Accept the valley, lean into dramatic irony
The gondola is a deliberate palate cleanser after digital chapters. The tension comes from the unknown (what's inside the mountain?) and from dramatic irony: the reader knows Sam's marriage is eroding, even if this scene feels temporarily warm. The playful banter reads differently after the birthday dinner rejection. Trust the reader to feel the gap between how nice this looks and how fragile it actually is.

### Option C (from outline review): Acknowledge the undercurrent directly
Sam is lying about why he agreed to come. He wants the mountain's closed-system survival data — multi-generational records of agriculture, population, energy, failure points — for his colonization work. Ramona thinks he finally took her up on visiting Tina. Add small beats where Sam's guilt surfaces — he's being unusually agreeable, overcompensating, or avoiding eye contact when Ramona talks about how much this visit means to her. The playfulness is real but it's built on a lie, and the reader should feel that even if Ramona doesn't yet.

**Recommendation:** Combine A and C. Sam is distracted by work clues AND lying about his motivation. The gondola is warm on the surface but the reader knows two things Ramona doesn't: his mind is elsewhere, and he has an ulterior motive. This makes the Contact blowup feel inevitable rather than sudden.

## Scene Beats (Sequence)

1. Gondola ride up - landscape, skiing memory, briefing
2. Summit - trailhead, arrival
