Sam clung to Ramona's hand as he stepped into the ancient ski lift from the platform. He was mindful of the gap in the dark. The gondola gave slightly to his weight, and he braced himself against the window with his free arm. Ramona stifled a laugh and smiled as he regathered his balance, then thudded onto his seat. He squinted subconsciously as his eyes adjusted to the well-lit interior. Ramona sat across from him and kicked her feet up beside him.

"Is this your first time in a cable car?" she asked with a little amused skepticism.
Sam replied, "Cease and desist."
Ramona called his bluff with a stare.
"It's been a long time. My grandmother took me up to the lodge for day camp over winter break once when I was 6 or 7. Just out of practice." He winked back at her with a manufactured smile.

The gondola was clear acrylic, like a giant ice cube with rounded edges. He could see in all directions quite clearly–even the benches were translucent. The image warped a bit at the edges of the cube. He looked up at the cabling suspiciously. Why was the bar a hook and not a loop? He much preferred a closed loop on the cable. The pulleys and cabling looked thick enough, he supposed.

Ramona laughed again. "It'll hold, don't worry. We pay good enough money for it."
"Why would Tina spend it all on maintaining an ancient ski lift?"
"Oh shut up and have some fun, will you?" She kicked at his shin playfully. "It's not *all* of the money, and it's needed for defensible foot traffic through the area. The hiking is really beautiful up there, besides, and honeymooners come to capture it quite often. It's almost a profitable business these days."
"Lovely! Maybe we won't have to fund the entire endeavor much longer if a few more youths share their videos up there."

Ramona set her feet back down on the floor. Sam looked down at their feet, a bit embarrassed by his miserly behavior. He saw some grey, rocky sand a meter or two underneath the gondola, with some shrubs huddling on the permanently shaded side beneath the platform. He saw a red tint and something move.

"I think there's a mouse or something by those bushes!", Sam pointed and leaned closer.

Ramona spread her legs a bit wider and tucked her head to see under her seat, making Sam smile.

"Oh, that's a baby jackrabbit. Vermin. There's an infestation of those little bastards. That bush is called shadscale."
Sam thought he was kind of cute.
"I think he's kind of cute."
Ramona wrinkled her nose. "Bleh. The coyotes can't kill enough of them. A few hundred years ago there were hawks and owls–big predatory birds–, that would swoop out of the sky and keep their population down"

Sam looked up towards the sky and tried to picture it swarming with enormous birds. He supposed it was no different than planes up close.

"I'd imagine that's why rabbits are so nervous."

The meter on the wall showed a bill total of 0.07091082 ETH, given the current passenger count.

"70 milliether for a 20 minute ride is egregious, Mona."
"Only 11 passengers, dear," Ramona said without looking up. "Perhaps a few more will join before we embark."

Ramona checked her watch casually, then kicked her feet back up.

"It's 7:32, so sunrise should be in a few minutes, I'd imagine we'll get going any–" 

The gondola jolted to life and the rabbit scattered. They started moving, up above the platform and inclining towards the summit. Floodlights polka-dotted the path up the black mountain where the lift towers stood sentinel. The gondola swayed in the breeze as they cleared the platform and floated noiselessly away from the lodge. Sam flipped sides of the lift and scooted in beside his wife, putting one arm around her.

"This is nice," said Ramona.
"It's basically as close to a date as we're going to get from here on out. I'm starting to see your little belly by the way." Sam leaned over and felt her little bump with his other hand. Ramona put both her hands over his and held his gaze.
"I know what hawks and owls are, by the way," Sam said, only half-joking.
"You are the worst." She laughed as she pulled her hands away.
"Well I learned and then immediately forgot what that bush is called at least."
"Shadscale."
"Right."

They continued the slow glide up to the summit. The deep blue sky was beginning to brighten, silhouetted by the mountain. The sky transitioned smoothly from dark blue above to a growing line of orange, betraying the location of the rising sun. The color gradient on the horizon began warping from flat and linear to circular; orange radiating outwards gradually, overtaking the blue. One by one, the polka dotted line of tower lights began winking out where the light touched them. Shadows resolved from the general dimness, stretching longer and wider across the foothills. The sun crested on the left side of the summit, and the shadows were all sucked back home, where they nestled into whatever nooks and crannies they could find.

Sam felt the hairs on the back of his neck rise, and ran his hand over them.
"Would you like the windows open?" asked Ramona.
"Uhh–" 

Ramona commanded the windows open without waiting for an answer, and they retracted into the lower half of the cube, leaving only vertical safety bars on the upper half. The wind whipped their hair into chaos. Ramona economically tied hers into a pony tail. The cables softly sang in the distance as they received lashings from the wind. They crested over a hill and could see Rossland off to the southeast, still sleeping in the valley. 

A steep canyon carved its way through the hills into the city center. Sam knew somewhere hidden in that fissure was the Colombia Arroyo, trickling down to where the city could absorb it. Further downstream, terraced polyculture fields flanked the riverbed, creating a perfect topographical map from the alpine lodge down to the city. It was too distant to distinguish what must have been a mixture of grapes, potatoes, maize, and dozens of other crops. Contour lines of green and ochre alternated down the farmland like the world's widest staircase. Roads switched back and forth across the steps, while miniature buildings and trees dotted along the path it made. The green emanated from the river bed outward, where it slowly faded to yellow, then brown. He could faintly resolve dunes to the south where shrub land gave way to desert.

"Do you see the old ski runs?" Ramona asked softly, drawing Sam back to her.
"There was snow year round at this height, and so many pine trees they had to carve paths down just so the people wouldn't crash into them."

"I think I saw a pine tree down in the shade by the ravine earlier," said Sam.
"There might be a few fragmented patches left in shaded areas. More likely some Joshua trees, but maybe it was a pine," replied Ramona, doubtfully. She had a rare talent for patronizing kindly, especially when it came to her husband.

Now that she had pointed it out, Sam could see the old trails had left subtle grooved into the hills. They were a bit chalkier than the surrounding dirt. They forked and merged seemingly at random, like fractured glass. Grass didn't really grow there, nor were there the bleached deadfall, shrubs, or cacti like the rest of the hillside.

Sam replied without looking at Ramona. "I went skiing once in the clouds. It felt kind of like floating for the stretches I could stay up, but I fell on my ass about every 12 seconds. The snow was really cold, and wetter than I expected... I can't believe how many lifts are still rusting out there. It seems the whole town would have had to ski at the same time."

Gondolas came down towards them from the summit. Sam started to wave but felt stupid when there was nobody inside. He counted 8 automatically. He turned to watch them descend the way they came, and noticed seven cars following Ramona and him up.

Ramona pointed out the other window. "Oh, look at the stratification! See the colorful striping in the rocks? The earth pushed flat seabed 3 kilometers into the sky at a 30 degree angle. You can count the layers like rings on a tree, but they're in millions of years. There's the metamorphic gray and white, those rocks are a billion years old. With a B."
"As opposed to the billions that don't start with B?"
"Shut it. Look at the beautiful red stripe there. That's the sedimentary layer. There's sandstone, mudstone, limestone, shale, chalk. If you searched long enough there you'd find trilobites, squid, fish, sharks, all of them shoved up the same rate your fingernails grow from sea level to twenty times higher than the tallest skyscraper in Duluth."
"So this was an ocean?"
"More like sea shallows. 100 million years ago or so. Cretaceous period with the Dinosaurs. You know, T-Rex, Triceratops, Spinosaurus, Velociraptor, Ankylosaurus, the cool ones." She counted them off on her fingers. "Though, most of those wouldn't really be found in this region anyway..."

Sam let her go on about geology and the past for a few minutes, absorbing what he could. He felt quite small, even more so than usual. The stripes *were* beautiful where the colors made it obvious to his untrained eye. He saw as he looked further up the mountain that the shrubs and cacti were getting more sparse, eventually giving way to scree and bare, brownish grey rock. It was remarkable how all of the plants knew to quit trying at about the same elevation.

"Oh, good, we're here," said Ramona as the lift slowed its ascent. Sam awoke from his daydreaming. The alpine lodge and platform came into view.
