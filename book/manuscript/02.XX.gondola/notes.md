# 02.XX Gondola

## Scene Goals

1. **World reveal:** Legacy human civilization is far bigger than Sam thought
	1. He believed: small extended family, 5-30 people
	2. Reality: more people under this mountain than in the city above (~10,000)
	3. Changes the scope of what he's been doing with energy/donations
2. **Sam realizes** he's been unknowingly keeping the ski resort functional through donations, funneling energy into their systems
	1. His wife has been managing this through him
	2. He's finally understanding the scope of what he let her do
3. **First underground visit** - wondrous, bustling, alive in unexpected ways
4. World reveal
	1. This is canada but it's a desert

## Setup

- Right before this scene: Ramona convinces Sam to come out (mechanism TBD)
- Just Sam and Ramona, no one else
- Kids at school
- Her belly getting bigger (passage of time marker)

---

## The Mountain (Symbolic Layer)

The mountain is a metaphor for **snapshots in time**. Everything Sam sees represents a different era frozen in rock.

### Ramona's Expertise

Ramona studied geology (or adjacent field). She can speak to the rock strata. Sam doesn't care as much - he's in the clouds mentally, barely noticing.

### Visual Layers (Bottom to Top)

**The lowlands (by city/river):**
- Terraced agriculture near the river
- Open woodland just beyond
- Transitions to grassland
- Then shrubland
- Then desert toward the horizon

**Going up the mountain:**
- Small patches of pine (struggling, beetle-kill)
- Mostly Joshua tree and yucca
- Bare exposed rock as elevation increases
- No snow, no snowcaps - barren granite and moss

### The Rock Itself (Millions of Years)

**Dry canyons:**
- Water carved these for millions of years
- Now no water to speak of
- The absence is the story

**Exposed strata (like tree rings, each stripe = millions of years):**
- Gray and white striped metamorphic rock
- Red rock hardscape
- Shale
- Mudstone
- Sandstone
- Beautiful colored stripes exposed by erosion

Sam might notice in passing. Ramona can explain. Reader connects it to the theme: we're all just snapshots, moments frozen in time, waiting to be compressed.

## The Gondola Ride

### Setting

- British Columbia, Canada - should be extremely cold
- Instead: desert mountain
- Late fall / January - sunrise very late at this latitude (9-10am at solstice)
- They can see sunrise coming up, blinding them as they ascend

### What Sam Sees Going Up

| Zone | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Base | Quiet wellness/rehab town, few people |
| Lower slopes | Deadfall, beetle-killed pines, some autumn color |
| Mid-mountain | Joshua trees, yucca, exposed rock |
| Upper | Bare granite, moss, lichen, no snow |
| Summit | Ski lodge converted to hiking trailhead |

### Skiing Memory (Brief)

Sam's never actually been up this mountain for skiing. Brief exchange:
- "So they had sticks on their feet and just... rode down?"
- "They needed snow."
- Leave it at that - they don't really know what skiing was, haven't seen it

### The Wildlife Shift

- Desertified landscape
- No snowcaps
- Species that used to be 500km south now dominate
- Mosses, lichens, whatever survives desert mountainscapes
- Beautiful but wrong

## Ramona's Briefing (In Gondola)

Before they arrive, Ramona briefs Sam:
- "Don't speak unless spoken to"
- "We'll meet [so-and-so]"
- Rules of entry
- He needs to follow her lead

---

## Gaps to Fill

1. **How does Ramona convince Sam to come?** - What's the inciting reason for this visit?
2. **Ramona's geology expertise** - What specifically did she study? How does she explain the strata?

---

## Scene Beats (Sequence)

1. Gondola ride up - landscape, skiing memory, briefing
2. Summit - trailhead, arrival
