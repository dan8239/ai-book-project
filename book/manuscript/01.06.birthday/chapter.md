## Scene Concept

Scene with wife based on a dream she was telling about Europe. Specifically, she was dreaming about their son — she saw in the dream a real face. Not [eldest], not [middle], but it was her son. That's unusual because most people in her dreams have blob face — she can't tell who they are, they're just kind of amorphous meat sacks.

In this particular dream, she was traveling to Europe and taking the subway with her son. They were doing some trip. The thought is that this is [third child/Hugo], because it was a few weeks before he was born, and it didn't look like [eldest], didn't look like [middle]. But it was her son, and it had a distinct face.

## Story Purpose

Really good for exposition for the protagonist, Sam, to talk to his wife, and for her to tell about what life in Europe was like. It could help tell us a lot about what's different in Europe than in the U.S.

## The Memory Map Gift

Sam gives his wife the [[worldbuilding/world/memory-map|Memory Map]] — the dashboard/frame gadget. It's there throughout the rest of the story to be used as needed.

Boil the lobster a little bit with what this thing's capable of, just to slowly get them immersed in what this thing can do.

## Europe Study Abroad Exposition

Wife gets into the study abroad stuff. Shows the difference in how — what is the typical college experience or study abroad experience, what is the one she did, and how does it differ in Europe versus America. It should tell you a little bit about the world.

### Stories to Include
- Wizard staffs — the drinking game
- Dressing like Euro Trash Night
- Things they did in those places that were unusual for this world

### The Map Geography

Instead of "we were in Madrid, and then we went to Portugal," the map should just be geocoordinate grids, hexagons, very exact numerical codes. They're basically just zip codes, but more exact. There still will be city names, but when they use a map or whatever to chart out where they all went, it will basically walk them through it.

Show the European study abroad as a map between just these codes mostly. Breeze through a few of them and leave somewhat of an Easter egg about what actual cities those were — they could match Becky's actual European study abroad.

### Tech Differences: The Poke

She talked about the phones — they'd have a "poke" or whatever, they called it something that was Spanish for poke, and they just call people. As long as it was under a minute, they didn't get charged or it got charged the rate of a text.

Use the exact same story basically in this world, but it's more showing the technological difference between Europe and where they are. Everything is just like all data usage — phone texts, asking a question on your phone — your energy use footprint is basically how much money gets spent.

Burgers are just literally converted to some rough order of magnitude CO2 equivalency. That's the unit of getting charged for things. But also everything you do just gets charged, like token usage, because you use your phone, there's some device in the cloud that is literally running to serve this. So you get charged your energy use.

## Economy Notes (for context)

The base human level survival kind of usage covers day-to-day stuff that's normal. The fact that Sam works gives him this feedback mechanism of more access to more advanced ML. It's just a feedback reinforcement loop that's slowly separating the species from post-human and regular human. That's why he has access to these things as well.
