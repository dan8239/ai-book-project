# Birthday Dinner — Notes

## The Dinner Scene Structure

Setting should say something about the culture — what does eating out look like in 2125?

### The Pattern (3 cycles)

The scene alternates between Sam working the colonization problem in his head and Ramona trying to connect. He's trying to make it up to her (this is a date night / birthday effort) but his mind keeps drifting.

**Cycle 1:**
- Paragraphs of him working the problem internally
- He almost has it
- Ramona interrupts with something he doesn't quite have context for
- He thinks about it briefly, gets pulled in for a moment
- Something she says gives him an idea
- He drifts back to the problem

**Cycle 2:**
- He goes deeper on the idea she inadvertently sparked
- He gets closer to solving it
- Ramona passes the conversation back to him
- He drops it, tries to be present

**Cycle 3:**
- He's so close now
- She can tell he's gone
- This leads to a fight
- He finally solves it for good
- He's on the couch

### What This Accomplishes

- Shows the compulsion in real time — he can't stop even when he's trying
- Ramona isn't nagging — she's trying to have a nice dinner, he's the one ruining it
- The irony: her casual observations are what actually solve his technical problem
- She's smarter than him in ways he doesn't value yet
- The couch is his Rock Bottom preview

### Memory Map Gift

She made him something special — a memory map. Places they will go. She also mentions something about Tina that starts to distract him, he agrees to go to the mountain. Then he loses the conversation. She makes a pass at him and he denies. Logs back on.

### TODO

- [ ] What restaurant / food tells us about 2125 dining culture?
- [ ] What is Sam's internal problem he's working? (colonization wall — environment optimization failing?)
- [ ] What does Ramona say that inadvertently sparks the insight?
- [ ] Japanese spider crab — is this still the meal? What seafood exists in 2125?
