"It's always higher than the estimate" said Ramona as she glanced at the displayed receipt, before waving it away and stepping out of the gondola.
"That's negativity bias my love. Kindly stay out of my lane", replied Sam as he gingerly stepped over the gap onto the platform.
Ramona was double checking her notes in a folded piece of paper, "Just past the welcome center, now. We can blend in with the tour for a bit."

From the parking lot it looked like the museum was surrounded by an enormous brown fence. Golden pickaxes crossed over the gate. Sam didn't understand what he was looking at until he was close enough to touch it.  

It was segmented. Each ring was thirty meters across, receding into the distance like vertebrae. A rusting machine lying dead on its side.

He walked toward the front and found the mouth—a disc of circular saws and spiked drums radiating from the center, frozen. Behind it, a 2 meter solid steel cylinder, then a tangle of pipes and conduit, then the body: segment after segment, wheels and barbs along the flanks, catwalks and conveyors running through the hollow interior. It was as long as a 10 car train.   

As they approached the gate, their devices queued them through subvocal interface that an audio tour was available for 6.1203 µETH, Ramona paid and merged their audio feed. Other tourists were congregating around them inside the threshold, apparently listening to the same audio.

Sam drank in the enormous map of the mining grounds as the tour agent spoke quietly in their ears. "Welcome! I see you've already met Anna Nicole! Commissioned in 2033 and completed in 2035, she was named after a renowned gold digger from the late 20th century, whose story captured the heart of former World Board Chairman, and Quant CEO at the time, Grant Melrose. Anna could advance 50 meters on a typical day, chewing through 15,000 metric tons of rock. She was in service from 2035 to 2052, all in Rossland, before the mine was decommissioned.

"Jesus." said Sam
Ramona muted her feed. "Hm?"
Sam grew animated. "5000 cubic meters of rock a day for 17 years. Even if they were working 200 days a year, that's 20 million cubic meters. That's the same as all the subway tunnels in St. Paul, Calgary, and Duluth combined. This mountain is swiss cheese."
"Mhmm." Ramona unmuted her feed and dragged Sam away from the map, catching up with the rest of the group.

The rest of the tour was fascinating to Sam. Ramona kept having to pull him along as he tried to speed read every plaque in their path. One talked about the timeline of the place. The mines had started in the 1890's with copper, silver, and gold, then closed in the 1920's. After sitting vacant for more than a hundred years the AI metals rush awoke interest in the region for a second time. There was an entire display about Anna (aliases Red Wiggler, The Ringworm). All the diamond coated bits on Anna were looted when word of the mine closing reached the workers. Nobody was ever charged in the theft. His favorite part of the tour was the enormous open vertical shaft in the courtyard that they let a volunteer drop an apple sized rock into. It took nearly 25 seconds to fall. When it finally hit, the sound slowly built up like rushing water, getting so loud the entire group covered their ears. 

Sam was following the crowd into the show mine for the "day in the life" exhibit when Ramona hooked his elbow and redirected him quietly. "Here's our exit, sorry to sidetrack your burgeoning career as a coal miner."
Sam followed dutifully, though his eyes lingered longingly at the mine.

They dropped the audio and turned onto one of the gravel tracks away from the welcome center, following signs for the dry tailings mounds (Sam was quite curious as to what that meant). It was a pea gravel trail, uphill the entire way. They passed a few old buildings and some beautiful views of the mining camp below. Everything sloped suddenly off to the right of the path, the severity varying anywhere between a gentle descent to assured death.  Anything interesting or suicidal was behind chain link fence. 

Sam was getting a bit winded. "How much farther?"
Ramona was doing just fine. She pulled the paper out of her front breastpocket. "A few minutes, I think. You know, Tina is going to love you. So will her folks. You're all essentially the same engineer hermit dork types."
Sam tried to keep her pace. "I'm excited to meet some of your family. Maybe I can retroactively ask some of them for permission to impregnate you thrice. Aren't they your folks, too?"
Ramona stopped on the trail and looked up at the chain link safety fence.

There was a pair of faded red sneakers with their shoelaces knotted and flung high over the safety fence near a sheer cliff. Ramona resumed walking while counting her paces. Sam followed. When she got to 50 she stopped abruptly and started looking around at the base of the fence. There was a small gap partially obscured by a prickly bush. Ramona was first through. Sam came through second, bleeding in a few places. Ramona handed him a faded climbing rope that hadn't been visible from the other side of the fence, but appeared anchored directly into the rock. It took something between persuasion and bullying but Ramona eventually convinced Sam to rappel 10 feet or so down to a rock shelf. There was a small gap at the base of the ledge. Ramona tied her backpack to her ankle, and did the same for her husband.

"I'm not going to fit", doubted Sam.
“It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.” preached Ramona.
"uhh... what?" questioned Sam. His wife rarely brought up religion, though they both had grown up in Catholic households.
Ramona explained, "You're such a heathen. It's a passage from the Bible. Most people think it literally means a rich man can't go to heaven. It was just a metaphor, though. Jerusalem had a gate called the eye of the needle. Camels were too tall to get through the gate, so they had to be coaxed down onto their knees where they would crawl underneath. It means you have to humble yourself before God."
Sam looked it up on his device. "It says here that gate bit was added as rationalization of the gospel because rich people didn't want to give their shit away. Heathens remain undefeated."
Ramona made a face. "Really?"
Sam checked a few more sources. "Yeah, seems like that one is complete horseshit."
Ramona conceded, "I hate when you do that."
Sam pled innocence. "What? Be right?"
Ramona clarified, "No. Fact check me against a database. Will you shut up and crawl through the hole already".

She went first, lighting the way with her device. Sam followed (there was more room than he anticipated). 

Inside was a decrepit concrete slab poured at a 30 degree incline, with two rusted cellar doors. It was padlocked in a three places and likely wouldn't open even if it wasn't. Ramona checked her paper one more time and took something from her pocket. She slid the something along the side of one of the cellar doors until an actuator clicked softly. The entire slab hinged open, slowly and utterly silent. Steel stairs descended into dark. As Ramona stepped down soft lights illuminated the staircase.
