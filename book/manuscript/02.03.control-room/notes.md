# 02.03 Control Room

## Scene Goals

1. **Sam's competence on display** - He instantly grasps the technology and does mental math that impresses the Chief
2. **Power dynamic** - Sam is being evaluated; they hold all the cards
3. **Legacy Humans need help** - They're at energy deficit, need optimization not just siphoning
4. **The Deal** - Sam agrees to help, setting up his optimization work

## POV Character

goal: he needs to get the DNA from the colony
conflict: his wife doesn't know that's his intent, he wants to make it subtle
stakes: He thinks it can save the species
decision: He'll help them a bit more, conditional on getting the DNA
consequence: He gets it but his wife feels used. They grow further apart. It was a big day for her.

## The Journey There

Long, 15 minute ride. Some shuttles on rails, transferred to something with wheels. Like the tunnels through CCDOC.

Before entering the control room, they pass through:
- Very mechanical room feel
- Big fans
- Enormous conduit running along the ceiling
- Gentle breeze lifting at all times (ventilation for the main chamber)
- Enormous racks like a library with containers stacked 30 feet to ceiling
- Automatic forklifts running and moving shit around

### Temperature Gradient

1. HOT as it gets lower
2. He has to put on a rain coat
3. Lower levels there's scalding water literally dripping from the rock as it's below sea level

### Feel

1. Exposed rock nearly everywhere
2. Conveyor belts
3. Heavy machinery crushing
4. Giant cement mixing looking drums
5. Cement walls, rebar exposed

### Mining Operations

Still mining, but no longer rare earth metals (those are all recycled at this point).

Mining for supplementing their topsoil - essentially unlimited supply:
- Potassium
- Calcium
- Magnesium
- Sulfur

**Limiting factors:** Water and energy

### PPE

Helmets/PPE hanging on walls for certain areas:
- Ear plugs
- Respirator
- Hood
- Smelting room: giant aluminum looking suits

### Squat Machinery

- Small flat rock carriers with wheels, very small clearances
- Giant spinning fucking nightmare on the mouth end of these things

## The Control Room

### Physical Space

**Think Chernobyl-era BMS controls:**
- Old-timey pneumatic controls
- Lights and buttons
- LEDs embedded in the wall
- Not modern computers

Enormous control room. Huge dashboards, displays, guys working the computers. Chief is monitoring the situation from his back office.

It's a total building replica. Looks kind of grainy/pixelated on the big screen, but clean. Everyone else is working on it.

### The Display

- ~20 foot wall
- Huge grainy LED array generating graphics
- NOT a Japanese TV - they can't just order new hardware
- Built from what they have
- Rudimentary resolution but enormous

**What it shows (can switch views):**
- Life support systems overview
- Calorie production
- Sewage and wastewater
- Aquifer status
- Jockey pump issue (could be prepped here)
- Food production
- Energy/battery graph (switched to later)

**The Problem:** They no longer have the ability to order a new high-quality display. Everything is built from available materials.

### Other Equipment

- Keypad and mouse interface
- Server racks stacked in the back room
- Electrical panels
- Self-regulating system but with manual override capability

### The Gauge

- Chemical/pH-style marker on the door (like H2S sensitivity test)
- Currently in green
- Everyone glances at it, checks watches when entering
- Ramona peeks at a guy's watch

### Material World

- No wood anywhere - everything plastic
- Reinforces the scarcity theme

## The Meeting

### Initial Setup

- Room is fairly full when they arrive
- Chief is clearly in charge
- Chief dismisses most people
- Also excuses most of the escort
- Keeps his **right-hand man** (potential POV for showing his thought process later)

### Opening Pleasantries

Back office. Pretext is everyone seeing Ramona again for the first time.

**Chief to Ramona:** "My condolences about your father" kind of deal.

Then: "Glad to hear you made it in all right."

Pleasant exchange, meet 5-6 folks in the guild (so-and-so is Tina's higher-up). Chief is head of all of it, head of energy.

### Chief's Opening

"Sit down. I suppose you're wondering why you're here."

Asks Sam: "Any guesses?"

(Soliciting guesses so Sam doesn't feel like a know-it-all dick)

### Sam's Math Flex

Sam does mental math based on what he SAW during the descent:

**The Calculation (spoken aloud):**

"Based on the number of floors, the power requirements to grow food... I felt it getting quite hot down here. My assumption is you've got some pretty serious cooling systems trying to regulate the temperature of this mountain.

You're freezing apple orchards year round on a rotating basis. Based on number of dwelling units and available rooms, I'd say you have somewhere between X and Y people.

Most humans take this many kilowatt hours per year. For our systems on the outside, our life support systems are X per year. The fact that this place probably has some pretty serious ventilation requirements and a lot of heat to reject... let's estimate it at this other number.

Assuming all that, I think you're probably looking at X gigawatt hours per year."

**Focus on the Gravity Battery:**

"Just taking a look at your gravity battery... we're not even to January, and I can see your battery is—just rough approximation from positions of all the cubes—you're at 11 or 12% capacity.

Based on the number... let's assume those are 10 by 10. I counted this many grids, this many cubes when I was roughly a quarter of the way around the perimeter. So you're probably at this height, this many total units. Based on the depth and number of floors, you're probably looking at total capacity of this many kilowatt hours, peak demand of this KW.

You wouldn't want more peak KW than your mountain can output, but it looked like you had some workers adding capacity. So you're probably a little short. Your peak demand is probably something like this.

So I'll revise the estimate—you're probably looking at about X number of units."

**The Deduction:**

"The fact that it's falling and we're not quite to January tells me... and honestly just the fact that you need a battery period tells me you're not on the grid. You're not using fusion. You're not using geothermal.

So you're on renewables—solar, wind—and your battery's there for when you're not in high wind, when you're in low light.

That situation, and the fact that your battery's at 10% and we're not even to January, with three low light months left... tells me you're at a deficit."

**Sam's Conclusion:**

"So I'm assuming the reason I'm here is because you're looking forward to your tie-in with the grid.

The question I have is: I've got a contract for X kWh—we've got a handshake agreement. That's barely going to make a dent in what your energy requirements are, if any of this shit I'm saying is right."

### Chief's Response

"Yeah, I mean, a few details are a bit wrong, but for the most part, that's right. So let's get into that."

**Corrections:**
- Density was off - blocks aren't concrete, they're denser material
- Assumed higher kWh per person than they actually use
- "We don't waste as much energy as you fucking **larvae** up there"
- "But generally... you nailed it."

**This is the starting point for the real conversation.**

## The Energy Crisis

### Visual Evidence (what Sam saw during descent)

- Lights already dimmed to critical infrastructure only
- Mining and expansion of the battery is paused
- Equipment just sitting there not being worked on
- People walking instead of taking people movers
- It starts as a squeeze

### The Current Situation

- Sam is already diverting energy to them through a front (~0.5% of his usage)
- They need more than that
- Sam's concern: "The whole point is you don't want to be found. You can't just be using that much energy. It's going to be anomalous. They're going to find you out. They're going to find me out."

## What They Want From Sam

Not just more siphoned energy. They want his **expertise**.

**Ramona/Tina's idea:** There's another way. This is his expertise—optimization. What are we optimizing for? You need to reduce energy. You need to get more runway.

**The Question:**
How much energy reduction do we need to make it to spring? Get to where the sun is going to hit the spring equinox and recharge the battery instead of running a deficit. How many more years does that buy us? What's the per-person reduction needed for a foreseeable runway?

**Sam's job:** Find energy savings. Not siphon more—find the waste.

**Why Sam does it:** For Ramona. For Tina. Not leverage, not blackmail. Family.

## Key Worldbuilding Details

### "Larvae"
- Insult for above-ground people (honeycomb residents)
- Suggests they're dependent, consuming, not yet fully developed
- Legacy humans see themselves as the real survivors

### Energy Efficiency
- Legacy humans use significantly less energy per capita
- Cultural/survival necessity
- Point of pride vs. the wasteful above-grounders

### Self-Sufficiency
- They build from what they have
- No supply chain to order new equipment
- Everything is repurposed, jury-rigged, but functional
