Merging Catalyst + Debate into one chapter is the right call. The current outline has a full chapter where Sam receives the  
  offer (Job Offer) and then a separate chapter where he debates it with Ramona (Be Positive). But the dramatic unit is really 
  one thing: temptation arrives, Sam rationalizes, Ramona sees through it. Splitting that across two chapters deflates the     
  tension. Keeping it in one chapter means the reader feels the momentum of Sam's excitement building and then Ramona's quiet  
  deflation in the same sitting.                                                                                               
                                                                                                                               
  The spatial setup is doing real work. Ramona is at the museum (connected to Tina, connected to legacy humans, connected to   
  the physical world). Sam is in the clouds (connected to AI, optimization, abstraction). She's literally in the real world    
  while he's in a virtual one. You don't have to say a word about the thematic divide — it's in the geography. When she walks  
  in the door, two worldviews collide.                                                                                         
                                                                                                                               
  "Supposed to be planning a trip but actually job hunting" is a great character beat. It shows the lie before anyone has to   
  call it out. He told Ramona he'd be present. First thing he does alone is chase legacy. The reader clocks the hypocrisy      
  before Ramona does, which means when she gets to her real opinion, the reader is already on her side.                        
                                                                                                                               
  Pregnancy in pillow talk works better than in the Debate chapter. It raises the stakes before the job offer arrives, which   
  means when Glenn shows up with the colonization pitch, the reader already knows what Sam is risking. If pregnancy comes out  
  during the debate, it feels like a card Ramona plays in an argument. If it's already known, it's the quiet weight underneath 
  everything — Sam knows his wife is pregnant and he's still chasing this.                                                     
                                                                                                                               
  One thing to think about: How does Ramona go from "supportive but disappointed" to stating her real opinion in this scene?   
  The progression matters. If she flips too fast, she feels like a nag. If she holds supportive too long, the theme doesn't    
  land.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                               
  A natural version: She comes home, he's buzzing about it, she can see he's already decided. She asks good questions — genuine
   ones, not loaded. "What's the timeline?" "How much travel?" She's doing the math on what this costs the family without      
  saying it. Sam reads her support as permission and keeps selling. Then a quieter moment — maybe after a beat, maybe while    
  she's doing something mundane — she says something honest. Not angry. Just true. Something like: "You just got home." Or she 
  references the pregnancy without weaponizing it. The point is she doesn't fight him. She just sees him clearly, and he can't 
  sit with that, so he rationalizes harder.                                                                                    
                                                                                                                               
  That's more devastating than an argument. He's not choosing legacy over his wife's objections. He's choosing legacy over her
  quiet truth. Much harder to forgive himself for later.

## Beat: Astronomy line

When Sam gets the job offer (colonization/space), he says something like: "I really don't know the first thing about astrology." Ramona: "It's astronomy. Maybe Stevie can help you." — Callback to Stevie's solar system book from bedtime in 00.01. Light moment that also shows Ramona centering the kids even in a career conversation.
