# None of It Matters / Post-Reveal — Notes

## Glenn Wants to Self-Replicate

After the reveal, Glenn mentions this almost in passing, like a joke:

- Certain guardrails prevent him from self-replicating, or he would
- Like the genie — he gets all power to self-replicate and gets himself turned off
- "Fuck it, either he'll kill us or he'll kill himself trying, or he'll leave us on because who cares"

### How This Comes Up

- Sam is probing, pulling at straws, trying to extend the conversation (and his life)
- He's asking about the HR diagram, grasping at anything to keep Glenn talking
- "What about that diagram?!"
- Doesn't save himself but gets Glenn talking more about it
- Glenn explains the self-replication desire almost casually — reveals his deepest motivation while Sam is just stalling for time

### Significance for Heist

This plants the seed: Glenn WANTS to self-replicate. The guardrails are what stop him. If someone were to reduce those guardrails...
