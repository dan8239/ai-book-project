# 00.00 Prologue

## Scene Goals

1. **"This day will live in infamy"** - Establish the weight of this moment
2. **Introduce Grant Melrose** - Tech mogul, ~50, Zuck/Musk hybrid
3. **Coffee Guy POV** - We see through his eyes but don't know it's him yet
4. **The Honeycomb Policy** - Explain what it is without full reveal
5. **End with takeover sequence triggering**

---

## Timeline Note

**Chronological twist:** This scene actually happens AFTER the final Coffee Guy scene in the book. The reader doesn't know this until the end. The prologue is the culmination of everything Coffee Guy has been working toward.

## Coffee Guy's Morning

### The Ride to Work (Peloton Cab)

**The Vehicle:**
- Automated cab with a Peloton inside
- Like a skateboard with a bubble on top
- Drivetrain and batteries underneath
- Bike mounted directly to the platform
- The kWh he burns on the bike is **discounted from the cab fare**
- When he asks for privacy, the whole bubble **tints**

**The Company:**
- This cab service is one subsidiary of Grant Melrose's empire
- Like Google Maps/Earth but Uber
- Just one small piece of the tech conglomerate

**The Ride:**
- Has article read to him - profile piece about the company, about him
- Pedaling the whole time (normal for him)
- Basking in his career's culmination
- This is the day everything changes
- He's the CTO - did all the technical work on Honeycomb

### The Article (Read Aloud)

- Profile of the company's rise
- Maybe show stock tickers / charts of their meteoric growth
- Coffee Guy's contributions mentioned
- The "policy" referenced obliquely
- Tone: triumphant, historic

### Arriving at the Office

- Semi-normal day for everyone else
- But he knows what's about to happen
- Goes to the bathroom
- **Practices his speech to the president for 25 minutes**
- Rehearsing his words, his tone, his gravitas
- This is the biggest presentation of his life

### The Interruption

- He's preparing for a call to the president **later that day**
- Gets called into **Grant Melrose's office** instead
- He never gets to make his speech
- They're ready now
- T-minus 10 minutes

## The Meeting

### The Power Structure (Sinister)

This is technically the **President's war room** - but Coffee Guy is called to **Grant Melrose's office**.

The President doesn't mention this as unusual. Doesn't buck it. Doesn't question why the tech CEO is running this meeting. Complete corporate capture of government - and everyone acts like it's normal.

### The Room

- "Bin Laden room" vibe - tense, momentous
- Small group of people who know what's about to happen
- Grant Melrose presiding (not the President)
- President is present but deferential
- **Coffee Guy is the lowest ranking person in the room**
- He's only there because he's the CTO who built this thing

### The Board

**Every person in this room will have a seat on the board of directors.**

This is the new power structure being established:
- Grant Melrose - Chairman (de facto leader, not elected)
- President - Board member (elected official, now subordinate)
- Other executives and officials present
- Coffee Guy - lowest ranking, but still gets a seat

**Within 30 years of takeover:** The board is gone completely. Replaced by the driver-controller system (Honeycomb governance). Human oversight phases out entirely.

### Grant Melrose (~50)

- Tech mogul type (Zuck/Musk hybrid)
- NOT the president - but clearly in charge
- High position on board of directors (Chairman)
- President defers to him completely
- Gives the big speech
- **He's not an idiot** - doing this for all the right reasons in his head
- Genuinely believes this is the best path for humanity

### Coffee Guy's Position

- Lowest ranking person in the room
- Built the thing, but doesn't control what happens with it
- His prepared speech (wanting 24 months) is irrelevant now
- That conversation already happened - they gave him 3 months while A/B testing
- Now he just watches
- Will get a board seat out of this (small consolation)

### Grant Melrose's Speech

- PR-vetted
- "This day will live in infamy" weight
- Kudos around the room
- Sycophants clap and praise
- Patting themselves on the back
- T-minus countdown in the background (implicit or explicit)
- Coffee Guy watches - this is his life's work being deployed

### What's Being Announced

The **Honeycomb Policy** is ready:
- Set of weights and balances that adjust policy based on world state
- All hyperparameters optimized
- The loss function explained (briefly):
  - Maximize: survival rate of the species
  - Minimize: human-on-human violence
  - Factor in: human rights
  - Other weights TBD
- 3 months of human-in-loop refinement (Coffee Guy wanted 24, got 3 - decided earlier)
- A/B testing already in progress
- This is the culmination of years of simulation work

### The Takeover

- Happens at T-0
- Systems compromised simultaneously
- Scene ends with the cascade beginning
- Cut to black (or to main story)

## Scene Beats (Sequence)

1. Coffee Guy in car, article being read to him
2. Stock tickers / company rise montage (optional)
3. Arrives at office, goes to bathroom
4. Practices speech to president for 25 minutes
5. Gets called in early - "They're ready"
6. The room - Bin Laden vibe, small group, Grant Melrose presiding
7. Grant Melrose gives the speech
8. Loss function / Honeycomb policy explained
9. Sycophants clap, kudos, back-patting
10. T-minus countdown
11. Takeover sequence triggers
12. Cut to black / main story

---

## Tone

- Triumphant on the surface
- Ominous underneath
- Reader should feel the weight without knowing exactly what's happening
- No clear party affiliation - keep politically ambiguous (president just re-elected, other party conceded)

---

## Callbacks

This scene will be echoed/completed in the final Coffee Guy scene (03.08):
- We'll realize the simulation work WAS this policy
- The "successful results" Coffee Guy delivers triggers THIS meeting
- The 12 months of human-in-loop finalization
- The blue/green rollout over 4 years

---

## Gaps to Fill

1. **The article content** - What specifically does it say?
2. **The speech content** - What does Grant Melrose actually say?
3. **The loss function details** - What other factors beyond survival/violence/rights?
4. ~~**Grant Melrose's name** - Resolved~~
5. **Coffee Guy's prepared speech** - What was he going to say to the president?
