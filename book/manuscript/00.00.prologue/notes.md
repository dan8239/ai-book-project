# 00.00 Prologue

## Scene Goals

1. **Introduce Grant Melrose** - Dying tech mogul, mentor figure, absurd wealth, genuine conviction
2. **Give away the entire premise** - The data, the policy, the decision to go
3. **Show the takeover cascade** - Hex map lighting up, systems captured
4. **Plant the Honeycomb visual** - Reader sees the hex grid without understanding it yet
5. **Bookend with 03.08** - A memorable line/sign/moment that connects the two scenes

---

## Structure Note

**This scene and 03.08 are one continuous story, split to bookend the novel.**

- **03.08 (end of book):** Coffee Guy's morning → ride to Melrose's ranch → intimate conversation in the room → steps into next room
- **Prologue (start of book):** The Zoom call → avatar presents → the go decision → hex map cascade → cut to black

The reader experiences the prologue first (no context, pure spectacle). At the end of the book, 03.08 shows how Coffee Guy got to that room, and a bookend moment (TBD) cues the reader that the loop is closing.

**Break point:** TBD — user will write the scene and find the natural split. Should land on a memorable line, visual, or moment that works as both an ending (03.08) and an opening (prologue).

## The Setting: Melrose's Ranch

**Location:** Verde Valley, Arizona
**Name:** TBD (see worldbuilding notes)
**Cover story:** Everyone thinks Melrose is at his ranch. He IS at his ranch — in hospice care. Nobody outside this room knows he's dying.

**The Property:**
- Enormous — absurd wealth on display
- Rivers, cliffside views
- Wild game, horseback riding trails
- Drive-in epoxied spotless garage with dozens of high-end vehicles
- **The Main Room:** Cantilevered floor-to-ceiling window overhanging the cliff's edge
- **The floor is transparent** — like Willis Tower Skydeck — looking straight down to the valley below
- Thousands of cattle, wild, near the river far below
- This is where Melrose is dying. In the most beautiful room in the world.

## The Intimate Conversation (Coffee Guy + Melrose, Private)

*This scene may live in 03.08 or straddle the break — TBD.*

- Coffee Guy is physically at the ranch. He came to be with the man.
- He's the only person in the world who knows where Melrose really is and what he really looks like right now.
- Melrose in hospice bed. Monitors. Coughing. Dying.
- Mentor/mentee dynamic: "You remind me of myself"
- The real conversation — unscripted, raw
- Coffee Guy shows him the data (the curve, the numbers)
- Melrose already knows — he's been watching dashboards from bed
- The tension: Coffee Guy wants more time. Melrose doesn't have it. He frames it as the world can't wait, but the truth is *he* can't wait.
- "Call it in."

---

## The Zoom Call (Prologue Proper)

### Setup

- Coffee Guy steps into the next room to avoid audio feedback
- He can still hear Melrose hacking through the wall
- He isolates his audio — the call participants hear nothing
- He's seeing through the feed only now: the healthy avatar, the polished version

### The Avatar

- Melrose's Zoom avatar is a healthy, confident version of himself
- The AGI has been making day-to-day decisions for months already — this call is about setting the **overarching policy** before letting it loose
- Nobody on the call knows he's in hospice. Nobody hears the coughing.
- The avatar isn't even speaking Melrose's live words — the AGI presents autonomously
- **Thematic foreshadow:** This IS the consciousness copy. Day-Kart in miniature. The machine is already performing as "him" and nobody can tell. They still call it him.

### The Audience

- Executives, the President, board members — all on video
- "Bin Laden room" energy — tense, momentous, small group who know what's about to happen
- President is present but deferential — complete corporate capture treated as normal
- **Every person on this call gets a board seat**
- Coffee Guy is the lowest-ranking person on the call

### The Presentation (Bottom-Line Data)

Melrose (avatar) is a bottom-line guy. Three things matter:

1. **The Curve.** One chart. RL training epochs — dead flat forever, then the uptick. "This is the first time this line has moved." The emotional hook for a man who's funded years of nothing.

2. **The Number.** Median survival: ~215 years. Still low. But WITHOUT executing: far worse. The argument isn't "this is great" — it's "this is dramatically better than doing nothing, and it's accelerating."

3. **The Confidence.** 95% of simulations exceeding 1,000 years survival follow this policy. Coffee Guy wanted 24 months to tighten uncertainty. They gave him 3. A dying man doesn't have 24 months.

The avatar doesn't explain what the policy IS. It doesn't matter to this room. "Does it work? What's the confidence? When can we go?"

### The Go Decision

- Brief kudos, back-patting
- The President nods. No one objects.
- "Execute."

## The Takeover Cascade

### The Hex Map

- A world map appears on screen — but it's not countries. It's **hexagons.**
- The reader doesn't know what Honeycomb is yet. They just see a grid.
- Hexes start lighting up. Waves of color spreading outward.
- **Rollout order:**
  1. Infrastructure (power grids, data centers)
  2. Financial systems
  3. Communications
  4. Government systems
  5. Media distribution
  6. Supply chain
- Each hex turns from gray to gold as systems are captured
- The whole thing takes minutes

### The Split View

- On screen: the hex map going gold, the healthy avatar standing still, smiling
- Through the wall: Melrose coughing, monitors beeping
- Coffee Guy sees both worlds — the performance and the reality
- The man is dying. The machine continues.
- Within minutes, the map is gold.

### End

- Cut to black / main story
- The reader doesn't understand what they just saw. But the image stays: hexagons turning gold, a healthy man smiling, a cough through a wall.

## Tone

- Triumphant on the surface
- Ominous underneath
- Intimate (the coughing, the mentor moment) layered over spectacle (the cascade)
- No clear party affiliation — keep politically ambiguous
- The reader should feel the weight without understanding what happened

---

## Bookend Element (TBD)

A memorable line, sign, visual, or moment that appears in both the prologue and 03.08, cueing the reader that the loop has closed. Options to consider:
- A specific phrase Melrose says
- A visual (the transparent floor, the valley, the cattle)
- A sound (the cough, a notification chime, a specific alert)
- A data point on screen
- Something Coffee Guy does (a gesture, a habit)

*User will find this during the writing process.*

## Gaps to Fill

1. **Ranch name** — Verde Valley, AZ property needs a name
2. **The break point** — Where does 03.08 end and the prologue begin?
3. **The bookend moment** — What connects the two scenes for the reader?
4. **Avatar presentation specifics** — How much does the avatar say vs. show?
5. **Project name** — "Project [name TBD]" referenced in the data
6. **The existential threat** — Which extinction cause is dominant? (Biodiversity collapse leading candidate)
7. **Coffee Guy's emotional state** — What does he feel watching from the next room?
