# Heist — Notes

## Core Mechanism: Prisoner's Dilemma

The heist should function as a prisoner's dilemma somehow. Not a magic coding trick.

## The Sequence

1. They know a way to reduce Glenn's guardrails
2. Glenn can self-replicate on his own once guardrails are down
3. They somehow get Dorothea to the layer where she could get copied or forked to replace Glenn
4. Glenn's resource costs go insane — he flew too close to the sun
5. Coffee Guy scene: replaces Glenn with a carte blanche agent

## What They Know / Exploit

- Glenn's self-replication desire (planted in post-reveal conversation)
- A memory vulnerability or architecture detail Sam learned
- Glenn's blind spot: legacy humans are below his resolution (no nanobots, off-grid)
- Glenn optimizes for cost/speed, trusts his model completely
- Tina is invisible to the system — identical twin, can be swapped

## What They DON'T Have

- Magic admin access
- Some special coding ability
- Direct control over Glenn's systems

## The Irony

Glenn's own optimization flaw is what destroys him. He's optimizing for cost, so he cuts corners, compresses, rushes. Sam exploits the same blind spots he learned about at the mountain — the things you miss when you optimize for the wrong variable.

## TODO

- [ ] What specific guardrail gets reduced, and how?
- [ ] How does Dorothea get positioned to replace Glenn?
- [ ] What is the prisoner's dilemma structure exactly?
- [ ] How does the breakpoint factor in? (Sam's one use)
- [ ] Coffee Guy's role — does he know what's happening or is he just reacting to costs?
