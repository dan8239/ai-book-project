# Reunion / Break into Three — Notes

## Ramona's Speech: "Why Are We Any Less Real?"

This is NOT when Sam and Ramona make up — that scene is about them. This is AFTER they reconcile, on the trip back to reconcile with Tina. Ramona helps Sam again. She gives this speech from her earth sciences background.

### The Thread: Sensing Your Environment

- We evolved to sense our environment
- Some animals see far. The raptors had incredible eyesight.
- Some animals could hear for miles. There once was an animal called a blue whale that could talk back and forth to its family from X miles away just using sound.
- Some sensed their surroundings so well they took off and found islands 50 days away. They knew animals came that way, and trusted enough to get in a boat with pigs and yams and a lot of faith.
- They learned empathy. They learned to help others they didn't even know, even other species.
- Most importantly, they learned to use complex math and immense patience to learn where they lived and how they got their power
  - They learned about the solar system and how we moved about the sun
  - They found other solar systems with other planets
  - They figured out what gases were on those planets, how gravity and air worked there, and how they might have to change themselves before getting in the boat there, and what to bring knowing you couldn't come back for a while

### The Punchline

- Sam guesses sarcastically: "Blue whales figured all that out?"
- Ramona laughs

### The Turn

- "And they figured out that outside of all of this, is another very similar world. And we're living on distributed computers somewhere in Virginia." (Not our Virginia.)
- "You've sensed further than any other creature has. You're special to me."
- "Do you think Glenn knows more about people up there than you do about people down here?"
- "Damon or whoever is up there couldn't possibly truly understand what living in a mountain here is like."
- "You know more about them. And that's why you're going to find a way to save us."

### Why This Works

- Ramona reframes the simulation as just another environment to sense and navigate
- The Polynesian waka metaphor comes full circle — getting in the boat with faith
- She gives Sam the confidence AND the strategy: his advantage is understanding humans, not systems
- Glenn doesn't understand humans. Sam does (because the mountain taught him).
- This is the moral center doing what the moral center does — seeing clearly when everyone else is panicking
