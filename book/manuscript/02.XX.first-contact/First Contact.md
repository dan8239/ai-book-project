Sam followed Ramona down the steel grated steps. Their steps reverberated from deep within the rock. At the bottom the steel grated stairs gave way to gravel. The path was illuminated before them for a few dozen paces. The tunnel was carved straight through the rock in a near perfect circle, descending slightly into the darkness.

Ramona checked her wrist as if she were wearing a watch, then flexed her fingers and rubbed the skin on her wrist where one might have been worn. She breathed in deeply through her nose with her eyes closed, squeezed Sam's hand then took off down the tunnel as she exhaled. "Not far now."

All along the perimeter of the tunnel was what looked like mesh netting, stapled into place every few meters. The air surprisingly wasn't stale, a steady flow of air was at their backs. There was a chalky, damp smell to the place. Gravel crunched at their feet as they walked.

They didn't walk far into the darkness before occupancy sensors triggered lighting arrays further down their path. They walked for a long time in silence, Ramona occasionally checking her little treasure map as the tunnel occasionally branched in multiple directions. For the most part they left sealed doors unchecked, and took the downward path nearly every time.

After what must have been ten minutes, the circular tunnel gave way to a squat, square room, so wide the lights didn't quite illuminate the far end. Racks were installed floor to ceiling in aisles, only interrupted by load bearing pillars of rock which were left while the rest of the room must have been carved out. The racks were filled with clear bins, pressure sealed from the top down, stacked, and labeled. Potatoes, yams, rice, roots, beans, corns, seeds, it was seemingly a food cellar. They walked to the far end.

Ramona frowned at her map as she tried the handles on the double doors to no avail. "There's no further instr—"

"RAAAAAH!" A dark figure emerged from a nearby pillar and lunged at Sam with its arms raised, and he stumbled back into a nearby pillar squealing. Ramona flinched as well, instinctively positioning herself between Sam and the figure with raised fists. Then Sam heard Ramona's laugh and his fear gave way to confusion. But it wasn't Ramona laughing, it was the figure, pulling up a balaclava to reveal a smiling, friendly face.

"I almost knocked your teeth into your tonsils," grumbled Ramona as she gave her older sister a long hug. 
"Still would've been worth it! I hope you didn't shit yourself, Sam!" replied Tina, wiping a tear from the corner of her eye as she attempted to stop laughing.
"Do you store underwear in any of these boxes?" reposted Sam, weakly, as he stood. He waited his turn for a hug, brushing dust off of the back of his pants.

Tina was a reflection of her sister except with contrast set all the way down on her skin color. She was so pale it was almost translucent, with no other noticeable differences in their facial features. She wore French braids down just past her shoulders. Her long sleeved cotton button-down was form fitting, with old jeans and composite-toe boots. She wore a watch on her wrist and a tool belt around her waist, swung back behind her.

Sam shuffled as his turn still hadn't arrived. Ramona's shoulders heaved slightly, and Tina finally pulled away to address Sam.
"I can't thank you enough for this."
"It was nothing. Ramona did most of the arrangements, anyway. Thanks for letting me tag along." He gave her a brief, stiff hug.
"No, really." Her blue eyes met his for a long beat. He broke first, addressing his wife.
"So, can I get the tour?"

Tina lazily lifted her wrist to the door, leaned against the panic bar, and swung it open. 

They emerged into an expansive atrium. A walkway surrounded a roughly circular courtyard at the center, too large to see fully across. An enormous dome was overhead, providing the illusion of daylight. A black hole opened in the center of the dome. A steel lattice made a repeating grid down from the dome down into the center courtyard. Cables hung down between the steel, distributed evenly between the steel frames. Enormous grey cubes hung on some of the cables even with the level they were on, bigger than his apartment. 

As he approached the clear guardrail, he felt an enormous updraft, strong enough to whip his hair out of place. The pit sunk into the void, a seemingly bottomless abyss. There were more of the cubes below their current level, randomly spaced, like a stone waterfall frozen in time. He saw a few of the cubes descending almost imperceptibly downward. He estimated about ten percent of the wires had blocks on the top level. Twenty percent or so were visible somewhere further down the pit. The remainder was nowhere to be seen.

"I had almost forgotten." said Ramona softly, smiling as she leaned over the railing. She re-tied a strand of hair that had come loose from her pony.
"How many..." Sam trailed off.
"Let's go home," said Tina, guiding her sister from the edge around the walkway towards a bank of clear elevators.

Sam followed but kept his gaze at the stone waterfall. couldn't make out the far side of the pit, but the mountain was bustling. Workers dressed similarly to Tina had a few of the stone block cables locked out and were providing service to the anchored struts. Further down a few floors a walkway was closed where a few workers were manipulating a robot remotely. It scaled the wall, probing, adjusting, and ultimately grinding rock away, impossibly loud. The rock melted off the wall down a corkscrew hose to a squat wheeled trailer. A few workers walked casually on the steel lattice without so much as a safety harnass or guardrail, and he could see there were man sized gaps providing passage through each joint. He saw a couple eating lunch together with their legs dangling over the side of a steel beam.

Lining the stone waterfall on each side was a mix of walkways and floor to ceiling windows in what appeared to be living quarters. Floor after floor of windows, like a a skyscraper had been unfurled and wrapped outside-in around the gaping hole in the mountain.

They took the first elevator that came, which gave a perfect view of the old mine shaft.  He people-watched floor after floor. Some had blinds closed and he could only see silhouetted shapes behind, others were more voyeuristic. He saw people working at terminals, lifting weights, running, sleeping, fucking. They kept moving down. His ears popped and he realized he'd been missing out on a conversation between Tina and Ramona.
