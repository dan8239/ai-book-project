# 02.XX First Contact

## Scene Goals

1. **Scale reveal** - Legacy human civilization is far bigger than Sam thought (more people under this mountain than in the city above, ~10,000)
2. **Sam's competence on display** - He instantly grasps the technology and does mental math that impresses the leadership
3. **Power dynamic** - Sam is being evaluated; they hold all the cards
4. **World reveal** - How legacy humans live, their technology constraints, their attitude toward "larvae" above
5. **Legacy Humans need help** - They don't have enough input. They need to buy time. They need to add more power sources. Shaving 10% of energy use would give an extra 18 months before the battery is tapped and they start losing essential systems.

## The Descent

### The Tunnel Structure

**Shape and Scale:**
- ~2.5 meter diameter, circular (reinforces the boring worm aesthetic)
- This is the residential entrance—just a people walkway, not freight
- Steel catwalk on the bottom, 3-4 feet wide (can walk side by side but clearly single-file intended)
- Smooth curves throughout (no elbows)—everything gently turns
- Subtle gradient descending the whole way

**Wall Construction:**
- Wire mesh netting covering exposed rock
- Steel rods hammered into rock like staples, holding mesh in place
- Transitions to concrete spray the further in it gets

**Infrastructure:**
- Conduit running for lights (minimal)
- PVC piping running through holes near the ceiling, forking with the path
- French drains / water collection underneath the catwalk (no water sounds yet)
- Occasional junctions—forks, stairs going down, locked doors to empty rooms

**The Walkway:**
- Steel grid catwalk
- Occupancy lights illuminate ~15 feet ahead, turn off behind
- Feels like being led

### Sensory Details

**Sound:**
- Footsteps echo for an insane amount of time
- Eerily silent otherwise
- Later: Sound of water (aquaponics, drainage)
- Later: Sound of fans (ventilation)
- Occasional electrical buzz (not constant)

**Air:**
- Stagnant at first
- Then a breeze at his back, sucking toward where they're going
- Air quality: on walkway = whatever's outside; deeper in = perfect

### Mechanical Room Feel

As they go deeper, the journey should feel like passing through the guts of the place:
- Big fans
- Enormous conduit running along the ceiling
- A gentle breeze lifting at all times (ventilation for the main chamber)
- Squat, jointed people movers snaking through the grid
- People operating diggers remotely with headsets

### Conversation During Descent

**Open Question:** What does the conversation need to advance?

**Options to consider:**
- Sam calling out Ramona: "This is more than 15 or 20 people, isn't it?"
- Ramona explaining the rules more seriously (tone shift from the gondola)
- Building tension—this isn't a casual visit
- Setting up the quid pro quo (what Sam might offer vs. what they need)

**Mood:**
- Quietly following Ramona
- Taking things more seriously with each echoing step
- The expanse of what's still to come is audible but not yet visible

---

## First Contact / Security

### The Checkpoint Room

**Physical Space:**
- Squat room with pillars (carved out square, but rock pillars left in a grid for support)
- French drains at edges—everything gently slopes toward walls
- Could double as a false stash / logistics warehouse (racks of supplies, makes intruders think this is the end)
- Security gates, access codes
- Feels like an entry/exit checkpoint (think going through Cook County security)

**Mood:**
- Sam realizes this goes way deeper than Ramona's immediate ~15-20 person family unit
- The scale hints at the population reveal to come

### Meeting Tina

**The Entrance:**
- Tina may jump out from behind a pillar and scare the shit out of them (prank option)
- OR: punches in a combination, unlocks a door, and is waiting there
- First contact with Tina before the intake meeting

**Sam and Tina's History:**
- They've met a few times before (can't be married 10 years without meeting the close twin sister)
- But it's been a few years
- This is Sam's first time underground

**The Sisters' Reunion:**
- Ramona is wiping tears, SO happy to see her
- Hugging, kissing, looking at each other
- Ramona: "Oh my gosh, you did this thing with your hair" (or new earrings/nose ring—something to show familiarity)
- **Tina is less overjoyed than Ramona** (TBD why—resentment? Stoicism? Underground culture?)

**Sam and Tina:**
- Tina might comment on his weight: "Gained a few pounds, huh?"
- Sam: "Nice to see you too, Tina."
- Joking, but with a slight edge—she gives him a hug anyway
- They have a rapport but it's not warm

### The Processing

- They're talking in whispers in the other room
- Sam tries to ask questions, gets shushed
- Ramona squeezes his hand—**don't talk**
- They don't give him the full rundown
- Eventually: "Come with me."
- Tina: "I can just escort you through"—she has access

## The Waiting Room

### First Real Interior Space

- Not just tunnel anymore
- Can take in the design
- **Ductwork visible**, frills gently blowing
- **Air is perfect** - immediately noticeable
- **Epoxy sealed** - no cracks, nothing uncontrolled coming in or out
- French drains at lower levels (not here yet - still high up)
- it's an enormous room carved out in squares, but giant rock pillars remain in a grid

### Material World

- **No wood anywhere** - everything is plastic
- Wood is very difficult to come by in this world
- Everything intentional, nothing accidental
- Contrast to the chaos above

### Sam's Observations

- Everything intentional
- Nothing accidental
- Contrast to the chaos above

## The Gravity Battery (Main Chamber)

### The Reveal

They pass through what looked like a rock face (opens as an enormous slab—everything still secret at this point). Walk out onto a small overhang platform.

**No Safety Fencing:**
- Literally no safety fencing anywhere in this place
- Sam: "What's up with the no safety fencing?"
- Tina (or guide): "We don't need stupid around here." (one-liner)

The edge goes around the perimeter in all directions. Sam sees:

**Scale:**
- Football fields wide
- Can't see to the other side
- World's largest Rubik's Cube made of concrete

**The Shape:**
- Old mine shaft, widened over time
- Generally circular but organic - blocks form-fit to available space
- Not perfectly geometric - follows the natural contours of the excavation

**The Blocks:**
- Concrete-ish cubes on steel runners/wires (actually denser material than concrete)
- Random ones at top, can't see bottom
- No discernible pattern - looks like noise
- ~1 in 10 blocks at top (most are down = discharged)

**The Structure:**
- Insane steel framework at top
- It looks like the sistine chapel. Perfect dome giving way to a black hole at the top
- He feels an updraft that's really strong
- Megamodule design going up the entire way. It's a giant willis tower in there with grids, but even bigger. The blocks go down between
- It's like smaller gravity blocks within a tic tac toe lattice
- maintenance folks are walking on the struts, no safety stuff

**The Floors (Key Detail):**
- Flat levels with spiral stair access at same spots on each side
- Each level is glass-windowed like the side of an office building
- Can look in and see people working
- Some have blinds closed
- Lights on some, not others
- Christmas lights hanging in a few
- People are clearly **living** here - huge population

**Activity:**
- **Bustling** - construction crews everywhere
- Workers on scaffolding carving out more width
- Robotic/mechanical mining equipment strapped to the walls, grinding blocks out of stone
- Guys nearby commanding it with walkie-talkies
- Cones of workers on some blocks (maintenance)
- Some blocks out of service

### The Expansion Work

Sam looks down and across to further levels:
- Guys hanging on scaffolding
- Carving out more width in the cavern
- Making room for more battery capacity
- Semi-manual work with machine assistance (safe robotic tech, but still fairly hands-on)
- The scale requires machine help, but it's not fully automated

### Sam's Reaction

- Starts to speak
- Ramona squeezes his hand - **don't talk**
- Sharp glance
- He observes silently

---

## The Elevator Down

### What Sam Sees

- Glass doors, can see everything
- As elevator descends (using power)...

### The Optical Illusion

- One of the blocks that was descending **stops**
- Then **starts rising again** - slowly, more slowly than Sam is descending
- Sam isn't sure if he's imagining it - optical illusion of him going down while that one goes up
- None of the other blocks seem to be moving
- The elevator going down = power draw = block rises to compensate

**Sam realizes:** The whole system is live, responding in real-time to every load.

---

## The Control Room

### The Journey There

long, 15 minute ride. Some shuttles on rails, transfered to something with wheels
like the tunnels through CCDOC

Before entering the control room, they pass through:
- Very mechanical room feel
- Big fans
- Enormous conduit running along the ceiling
- Gentle breeze lifting at all times (ventilation for the main chamber)
- enormous racks like a library with containers stacked 30 feet to the ceiling. Automatic forklifts running and moving shit around

Temperature Gradient
1. HOT as it gets lower
2. He has to put on a rain coat
3. Lower levels there's scalding water literally dripping from the rock as it's below sea level

Feel
1. Exposed rock nearly everywhere
2. conveyor belts
3. heavy machinery crushing
4. giant cement mixing looking drums
5. cement walls, rebar exposed

Still mining, but no longer rare earth metals, those are all recycled at this point
1. Mining for supplementing their topsoil. Essentially unlimited supply
	1. potassium
	2. calcium
	3. magnesium
	4. sulfur
2. Limiting factor is the water and energy

PPE
1. Helmets/PPE hanging on walls for certain areas
2. ear plugs
3. respirator
4. hood
5. Smelting room giant aluminum looking suits

Squat machinery
1. Small flat with wheels rock carriers, very small clearances
2. Giant spinning fucking nightmare on the mouth end of these things

### The Room Itself

**Think Chernobyl-era BMS controls:**
- Old-timey pneumatic controls
- Lights and buttons
- LEDs embedded in the wall
- Not modern computers

**The Display (Key Detail):**
- ~20 foot wall
- Huge grainy LED array generating graphics
- NOT a Japanese TV - they can't just order new hardware
- Built from what they have
- Rudimentary resolution but enormous
- Shows: battery graph, energy sources, production rates, energy in/out

**The Problem:** They no longer have the ability to order a new high-quality display. Everything is built from available materials.

**Other Equipment:**
- Keypad and mouse interface
- Server racks stacked in the back room
- Electrical panels
- Self-regulating system but with manual override capability

**The Gauge:**
- Chemical/pH-style marker on the door (like H2S sensitivity test)
- Currently in green
- Everyone glances at it, checks watches when entering
- Ramona peeks at a guy's watch

**Material World:**
- No wood anywhere - everything plastic
- Reinforces the scarcity theme

---

## The Meeting

### Initial Setup

- Room is fairly full when they arrive
- Leader is clearly in charge
- Leader dismisses most people
- Also excuses most of the escort
- Keeps his **right-hand man** (potential POV for showing his thought process later)

### The Leader

- Needs a name
- In charge of this whole operation
- Commands respect
- Curious about Sam

### Opening

Leader: "Sit down. First of all, I'm sure you have some questions. Let me start with the giant block thing in the room..."

### Sam's Math Flex

**Instant Recognition:**
Sam interrupts: "It's a battery. It's a gravity battery."

This surprises/impresses the leader - he expected to have to explain.

**The Calculation:**
Sam does mental math in real-time:
1. Counts/estimates number of blocks
2. Assumes they're concrete (wrong - they're denser)
3. Calculates kWh storage capacity
4. Estimates how many "windows" (living units) he saw
5. Glances at the LED display - figures out energy in/out rates
6. Calculates average kWh per person (real-time and daily, especially peak)
7. **Estimates the total population**

**The Leader's Reaction:**
- Eyebrow raise
- Impressed
- "Not bad..."

**The Corrections:**
- "Your density was off - they're not concrete, they're [denser material]"
- "You assumed higher kWh per person than we actually use"
- "We don't waste as much energy as you fucking **larvae** up there"
- "But generally... you nailed it."

**This is the starting point for their real conversation.**

---

## Key Worldbuilding Details

### "Larvae"
- Insult for above-ground people (honeycomb residents)
- Suggests they're dependent, consuming, not yet fully developed
- Legacy humans see themselves as the real survivors

### Energy Efficiency
- Legacy humans use significantly less energy per capita
- Cultural/survival necessity
- Point of pride vs. the wasteful above-grounders

### Self-Sufficiency
- They build from what they have
- No supply chain to order new equipment
- Everything is repurposed, jury-rigged, but functional

---

## Scene Beats (Sequence)

1. **The descent begins** - Land at bottom of stairs, eyes adjust to dim occupancy lights
2. **The tunnel** - Circular bore, steel catwalk, mesh netting, echoing footsteps, eerily silent
3. **The maze** - Forks, stairs, locked doors, PVC piping through ceiling, endless descent
4. **Conversation** - Sam and Ramona dialogue (TBD what it advances—scale? stakes? rules?)
5. **The checkpoint room** - Squat pillared space, French drains, maybe false stash/warehouse
6. **Meeting Tina** - Entrance (prank or waiting?), sisters' emotional reunion, Sam's rapport with Tina
7. **The processing** - Whispers, shushing, "I can just escort you through"
8. **The threshold** - Rock face slab opens, breeze at back increases, step onto platform
9. **The gravity battery reveal** - No safety fencing, football fields wide, Rubik's cube of concrete
10. **Take in the scale** - Blocks, floors, workers, living spaces, Christmas lights
11. **Elevator down** - Glass walls, optical illusion with rising block
12. **Mechanical room passage** - Fans, conduit, breeze, racks and forklifts
13. **Enter control room** - Check the gauge, everyone checks watches
14. **Leader dismisses the room** - Keeps right-hand man
15. **Leader opens** - "I'm sure you have questions..."
16. **Sam: "It's a gravity battery."** - Instant recognition
17. **Sam does the math** - Mental calculation out loud
18. **Leader corrects** - Density, efficiency, "larvae" insult
19. **Real conversation begins** - The deal (scene ends or continues)

## The Energy Crisis (What Sam Sees)

The battery is going down. Not enough input.

**Visual Evidence:**
- Lights already dimmed to critical infrastructure only
- Mining and expansion of the battery is paused
- Equipment just sitting there not being worked on
- People walking on their own instead of taking the people movers
- It starts as a squeeze

**The Current Situation:**
- Sam is already diverting energy to them through a front (~0.5% of his usage)
- They need more than that
- Sam's concern: "The whole point is you don't want to be found. You can't just be using that much energy. It's going to be anomalous. They're going to find you out. They're going to find me out."

---

## What They Want From Sam

Not just more siphoned energy. They want his expertise.

**Ramona/Tina's idea:** There's another way. This is his expertise—optimization. What are we optimizing for? You need to reduce energy. You need to get more runway.

**The Question:**
How much energy reduction do we need to make it to spring? Get to where the sun is going to hit the spring equinox and recharge the battery instead of running a deficit. How many more years does that buy us? What's the per-person reduction needed for a foreseeable runway?

**Sam's job:** Find energy savings. Not siphon more—find the waste.

**Why Sam does it:** For Ramona. For Tina. Not leverage, not blackmail. Family.

---

## Gaps to Fill

### Resolved
- ~~**What does the checkpoint security look like?**~~ - Gates, access codes, Tina escorts them through
- ~~**What's the dynamic between the sisters?**~~ - Ramona emotional/overjoyed, Tina less so (TBD why)
- ~~**What do they want from Sam?**~~ - Energy optimization, not just siphoning

### Still Open
1. **Why is Tina less overjoyed?** - Resentment? Stoicism? Underground culture? Something specific?
2. **What does the descent conversation advance?** - Need a purpose for the Sam/Ramona dialogue during the tunnel walk
3. **Tina's entrance** - Prank (jump scare) or just waiting at the door?
4. **Leader's name** - Who is this person? Background?
5. **Right-hand man** - Name, role, personality?
6. **What's the denser material?** - What are the blocks actually made of?
7. **The gauge** - What exactly is it measuring? Air quality? H2S? Something else?
8. **The false stash layer** - Include logistics warehouse as misdirect, or cut for pacing?
